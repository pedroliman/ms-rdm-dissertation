@article{Sterman2007,
abstract = {Prior research on competitive strategy in the presence of increasing returns suggests that early entrants can achieve sustained competitive advantage by pursuing Get Big Fast (GBF) strategies: rapidly expanding capacity and cutting prices to gain market share advantage and exploit positive feedbacks faster than their rivals. Yet a growing literature in dynamics and behavioral economics, and the experience of firms during the 2000 crash, raise questions about the GBF prescription. Prior studies generally presume rational actors, perfect foresight and equilibrium. Here we consider the robustness of the GBF strategy in a dynamic model with boundedly rational agents. Agents are endowed with high local rationality but imperfect understanding of the feedback structure of the market; they use intendedly rational heuristics to forecast demand, acquire capacity, and set prices. These heuristics are grounded in empirical study and experimental test. Using a simulation of the duopoly case we show GBF strategies become suboptimal when market dynamics are rapid relative to capacity adjustment. Under a range of plausible assumptions, forecasting errors lead to excess capacity, overwhelming the cost advantage conferred by increasing returns. We explore the sensitivity of the results to assumptions about agent rationality and the feedback complexity of the market. The results highlight the risks of incorporating traditional neoclassical simplifications in strategic prescriptions and demonstrate how disequilibrium behavior and bounded rationality can be incorporated into strategic analysis to form a dynamic, behavioral game theory amenable to rigorous analysis.},

@article{Dattee2007,
abstract = {Diffusion models of technological innovations are often based on an epidemic structure which has a good fit to historical data but whose communication assumptions lack explanatory power. They assume a simplified decision process, uniform decision criteria across adopters categories, and a fully interconnected social structure. The objective of this paper is to show that the dynamics of social factors during technological substitutions have significant effects on substitution patterns. The success of a paradigmatic shift is not only a function of technological characteristics but also depends on change agents and many social dynamics. Such complexity requires analysis at several levels of granularity. We start with cognitive processes at the individual level using concepts from cognitive psychology and decision making under uncertainty and then move to interpersonal communications at the aggregate social level. We show that population heterogeneity generates different decision criteria and a social topology which greatly affect perceptions and the formation of expectations. The structure of interpersonal networks also explains how the relevance and credibility of information impact the critical mass dynamics of technology adoption. A more complete model accounting for social interactions provides a useful framework for understanding complex substitution patterns and reducing the risk of misreading the market. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Mahajan1996,
abstract = {Based on the behavioral assumptions of diffusion theory, this article proposes an extension of the Bass diffusion model that simultaneously captures the substitution pattern for each successive generation of a durable technological innovation, and the diffusion pattern of the base technology. Normative guidelines based on the model suggest that a firm should either introduce a new generation as soon as it is available or delay its introduction to a much later date at the maturity stage of the preceding generation. The decision depends on a number of factors including the relative size of the market potentials, gross profit margins, the diffusion and substitution parameters, and the discount factor of the firm. This "now or at maturity" rule is thus an extension and generalization of the "now or never" rule of Wilson and Norton [25]. Empirical and normative implications of the proposed model are explored for four successive generations on IBM mainframe computers: first generation (vacuum tubes); second generation (transistors); 360 family (integrated circuits); and 370 family (silicon chips). The model describes the growth of these generations well. The application of normative guidelines suggests that IBM introduced the two successive generations of 360 and 370 families too late, i.e., their time to market should have been shorter. Limitations and further extensions of the model and the application are discussed.},

@article{Maier1998,
abstract = {The diffusion of innovations over time is a highly dynamic and complex problem. It is influenced by various factors like price, advertising, and product capabilities. Traditional models of innovation diffusion ignore the complexity underlying the process of diffusion. Their aim is normative decision support, but these models do not appropriately represent the structural fundamentals of the problem. The use of the system dynamics methodology allows the development of more complex models to investigate the process of innovation diffusion. These models can enhance insight in the problem structure and increase understanding of the complexity and the dynamics caused by the influencing elements. This article shows how the traditional innovation models can be extended to incorporate competition and to map the process of substitution among successive product generations. Several model simulations show the potential of using system dynamics as the modeling methodology in the field of new product diffusion models. {\textcopyright} 1998 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.

abstract = {R obustness is a key criterion for evaluating alternative decisions under conditions of deep uncertainty. How- ever, no systematic, general approach exists for finding robust strategies using the broad range of models and data often available to decision makers. This study demonstrates robust decision making (RDM), an ana- lytic method that helps design robust strategies through an iterative process that first suggests candidate robust strategies, identifies clusters of future states of the world to which they are vulnerable, and then evaluates the trade-offs in hedging against these vulnerabilities. This approach can help decision makers design robust strategies while also systematically generating clusters of key futures interpretable as narrative scenarios. Our study demonstrates the approach by identifying robust, adaptive, near-term pollution-control strategies to help ensure economic growth and environmental quality throughout the 21st century},
