This file documents changes to OpenMORDM after its initial release.
Special thanks to Greg Garner, Xuan Yi, Yu Li, Tori Ward, Xihao Deng, 
Perry Oddo, and the three anonymous reviewers for testing the software.


---------------------------------
Upgrading from a Previous Version
---------------------------------

If you previously installed an older version of OpenMORDM, you should upgrade
OpenMORDM with the following two R commands:

    devtools::install_local("OpenMORDM")
    devtools::install_local("rgl")

and also recompile the Borg MOEA and Lake Problem executables.


-------
Changes
-------

1) Fixes a number of compatability issues on different operating systems.
      * Fixes segmentation fault on Mac OS
      * Fixes invalid linker command -r on Mac OS
      * Fixes issue locating executable files on various systems
      * Adds required dependencies for Linux to README.txt

2) Improvements to README file.  Following the instructions now, the user should
   first try to recreate the figures from the manuscript.  After doing so, they
   can try the more advanced step of compiling the Borg MOEA and Lake Problem
   C++ code to reproduce the entire study.

3) Includes the missing rdyncall package that is no longer available on CRAN.

4) lakeProblemDemo.R previously selected Pareto design #274 for further analysis.
   As the Pareto set size may be different for each run.  The code now randomly
   selects a design.

5) Renamed several methods to be more descriptive of their function.

6) Generated a OpenMORDM.pdf containing all documentation.

7) Enabled support for two PRIM methods, from the prim and sdtoolkit packages.
