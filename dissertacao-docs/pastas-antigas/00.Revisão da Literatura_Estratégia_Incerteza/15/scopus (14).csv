Previous research has argued that this technology not only has profound effects on manufacturing businesses but also on society, which demands new corporate strategies and policies alike. Thus, the development of reliable future scenarios is key for strategic planning and decision making as well as for future research. Dedicated academic studies in this field remain scarce. We present the results of an extensive Delphi survey on the future of additive manufacturing with a focus on its economic and societal implications in 2030. Via an initial round of extensive qualitative interviews and a Delphi-based analysis of 3510 quantitative estimations and 1172 qualitative comments from 65 experts, we were able to develop and validate 18 projections that were then clustered into a scenario for the most probable future. The scenario is built on the six Delphi projections with the highest consensus on the likelihood of occurrence. We complement this most probable scenario with a discussion on controversial, extreme scenarios. Based on these findings we derive implications for industry, policy, and future research. © 2017 The Authors","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Delphi; Forecasting; Scenario development","Decision making; Forecasting; Industrial research; Manufacture; Printing; 3-D printing; Corporate strategies; Delphi; Manufacturing business; Qualitative interviews; Quantitative estimation; Scenario development; Societal implications; 3D printers","ASTM International, Standard Terminology for Additive Manufacturing Technologies No. F2792-12a (2012)Baumers, M., Dickens, P., Tuck, C., Hague, R., The cost of additive manufacturing: machine productivity, economies of scale and technology-push (2016) Technol.

This paper presents a review of 622 articles on organizational planning approaches for achieving a sustainable future, and organizes this literature into a taxonomy of four planning approaches (predictive, adaptive, visionary, and transformational planning) and their associated planning tools or methodologies. While the most prominent theme among the reviewed literature is that transformational change is necessary to address the sustainability challenges of the future, this review identifies a lack of planning approaches that: (1) connect planning to ecological limits; (2) provide guidance for tackling the sustainability challenges in developing countries; and (3) offer guidance to private sector organizations about how to engage in broader planning debates on societal levels. From these findings, a future research agenda is proposed that examines how organizations can plan for a sustainable future, establish a fit between planning approaches, tools and sustainability challenges, adapt governance and organizational structures for transformative change, and design for and facilitate future change. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Collaborative planning; Strategic planning; Sustainability; Sustainable future; Systematic review","Developing countries; Ecology; Planning; Strategic planning; Collaborative approach; Collaborative planning; Organizational planning; Organizational structures; Private sector organizations; Provide guidances; Sustainable future; Systematic Review; Sustainable development","Adams, M., Wheeler, D., Woolston, G., A participatory approach to sustainable energy strategy development in a carbon-intensive jurisdiction: the case of Nova Scotia (2011) Energy Policy, 39, pp. 2550-2559; Ansell, C., Gash, A., Collaborative governance in theory and practice (2008) J.

Under the aim of looking for improvement alternatives, it was decided to choose two companies incorporated more than forty years ago, engaged in providing electric and civil engineering consultancy services which, while facing an ongoing crisis situation, implemented actions which not only enabled said companies to remain active in the market but also, to strengthen their financial structure. The results obtained from the research showed that a balanced approach characterized by a timely decision making and the definition and implementation of effective business strategies are optimum tools to ensure a higher degree of business resilience.","Business lasting; Business resiliency; Disruption and turbulence",,"Ansoff, I., (1969) Business Strategy: Selected readings, 72. , Penguin Books; AtehortÚa, M., Resiliencia: Otra perspectiva de las experiencias sociales y personales dentro de la empresa (2002) Estudios Gerenciales, 18 (82), pp. 47-55; Courtney, H., Kirkland, J., Viguerie, S., Strategy under uncertainty (1997) Harvard Business Review, 75 (6), pp. 67-79; Coutu, D.L., How resilience works (2002) Harvard Business Review, 80 (5), pp. 46-55; Dante, R., (2002) Estrategia de Ventas en Tiempos de Turbulencia, , http://fce.uncu.edu.ar/investigacion/Jornadas/jornadas2002/Dis/Administracion/54/T54.pdf, Recuperado el 10 de Agosto de; D'Aveni, R., (1994) Hypercompetition.

They argue that this more complete picture of entrepreneurial phenomena will likely come from scholars who undertake at least some trailblazing projects; from scholars who broaden the range of research questions, the potential outcomes of entrepreneurial action, and the selection and combination of research methods; and from researchers who avoid the endless debates about the margins of the field and its sub-fields or about whether one theoretical or philosophical lens is superior to another. This book offers suggestions for future research through a variety of topics including prosocial action, innovation, family business, sustainability and development, and the financial, social, and psychological costs of failure. It promises to make an important contribution to the development of the field and help academics, organizations, and society make useful contributions to the generation of entrepreneurial research. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2017.",,,"Burrell, G., Morgan, G., (1979) Sociological paradigms and organisational analysis, 248. , London: Heinemann; Busenitz, L.W., West, G.P., Shepherd, D., Nelson, T., Chandler, G.N., Zacharakis, A., Entrepreneurship research in emergence: Past trends and future directions (2003) Journal of Management, 29, pp. 285-308; Carlsson, B., Braunerhjelm, P., McKelvey, M., Olofsson, C., Persson, L., Ylinenpää, H., The evolving domain of entrepreneurship research (2013) Small Business Economics, 41, pp. 913-930; Cole, S., The hierarchy of the sciences?

However, current roadmapping approaches fall short in effectively considering the uncertainty associated with future developments. In particular, existing methods cannot cope with uncertainty without destroying the communicative and directive strengths of roadmapping. This is especially a concern if roadmapping is to be widely used for strategic purposes. In this paper, we therefore introduce a comprehensible approach that enables firms to benefit from guiding their strategic innovation activities while still being able to consider a wide range of possible future business environments. To this end, we have developed the Scenario-Driven Roadmapping approach while aiming to ensure a robust roadmap. We present the results of an initial application of this approach in a major Dutch construction firm. The results showed that applying Scenario-Driven Roadmapping was effective in both reducing environmental uncertainty and in directing innovation towards promising business activities. In concluding, the paper makes recommendations on how to maximize the benefits of Scenario-Driven Roadmapping. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Business roadmapping; Construction industry; Scenario planning; Strategic innovation; Uncertainty","Innovation; Technological forecasting; Business activities; Business environments; Construction firms; Environmental uncertainty; Roadmapping; Scenario Planning; Strategic innovations; Uncertainty; Construction industry","Albright, R.E., Kappel, T.A., Roadmapping in the corporation (2003) Res.

To inform the efficient and sustainable development of the coal industry, this paper analyzes the sources of strategic risk for coal science and technology enterprises using 3 first-class indicators, 10 second-level indicators, and 37 observation points established through the existing research literature and experience. Moreover, in accordance to the obtained initial index data, the selected indicators have been tested and screened using reliability and membership degree analyses to remove redundant variables, avoid juxtaposition of risk factors at different levels, and reduce the influence of some tiny risk factors for enterprise strategic risk. Then, factor analysis of external environment factor sub-scale was carried out. Factors are extracted according to a standard characteristic value greater than 1. Variables with high coefficients are classified into one factor category; and finally, 3 first-class indicators, 8 second-level indicators, and 37 observation points are reconstructed. © 2016","Coal science and technology enterprises; Constructing; Risk assessment index; Strategic risk","Coal; Coal industry; Factor analysis; Gages; Risk management; Sustainable development; Analysis of external environment factors; Assessment index; Assessment index system; Constructing; Enterprise strategic risk; Industrial development; Science and Technology; Strategic risks; Risk assessment","Slywotzky, A., Weber, C., The strategic risk management (2007), CITIC Publishing House BeijingCourney, H., Kirkland, Strategy under uncertainty (1997) Harvard Bus Rev, 75 (6), pp. 67-80; James, M.C., Tmothy, W.R., Strategic risk: a state-define approach (1996), Kluwer Academic PublishersBaird, I.S., Thomas, H., Toward a contingency model of strategic risk taking (1985) Acad Manage Rev, 10 (2), pp. 230-243; Winfrey, F.L., Budd, J.L., Reframing strategic risk (1997) SAM Adv Manage J, 62 (4), pp. 13-22; March, J.G., Shapira, Z., Managerial perspective on risk and risk taking (1987) Manage Sci, 33 (11), pp. 1404-1418; Liu, H.C., Strategic risk management-new frontier of strategic management (2003) J Manage Eng, 17 (3), pp. 4-6; Liu, S.F., Overview of enterprise strategic risk management theory (2003) Modern Manage Sci, 23 (12), pp. 31-32; Zhang, R.L., Huo, G.Q., Analysis of the type, cause and countermeasure of enterprise strategic risk (2007) China Soft Sci, 6, pp. 50-57; Tang, H., Strategic objectives and risks of diversification (2001) Econ Theory Econ Manage, (2), pp. 43-45; Yang, H.J., Xi, Y.M., The model exploration of strategic risk management of group company (2002) Chin Soft Sci, 8, pp. 62-67; Zhu, A.M., Wang, H., Li, N.N., Analysis of component factors and formation mechanism of enterprise strategic risk (2006) Modern Manage Sci, (7), pp. 64-65; Feng, Y.F., Chen, Y., Formation mechanism of enterprise strategic risk (2008) J Wuhan Univ Technol, 30 (5), pp. 816-819; Li, H.D., Fuzzy evaluation model of enterprise strategic risk (2007) J Beijing Normal Univ, 43 (5), pp. 587-590",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84969972141

However, less attention has been paid to assessing the resilience of these initiatives to shifting strategic plans precipitated by changes in management priorities. While a particular infrastructure asset or technology may be resilient in a given scenario, the overriding strategic plan may be vulnerable to changes in decision maker preferences, regulatory restrictions, or other emergent shifts in values and objectives. In this paper, we describe scenario planning and decision making tools that may be used to assess the resilience of initiatives across a multitude of emergent conditions, including changing management priorities. Two case studies are presented in which this framework was applied: 1) creating sustainable biofuel supply chains for the aviation industry, and 2) prioritization of infrastructure development opportunities in Afghanistan. © 2016 IEEE.","business plans; deep uncertainty; risk management; scenarios; strategic planning","Risk management; Risk perception; Strategic planning; Supply chains; Biofuel supply chains; Business plans; Decision maker preferences; Deep uncertainties; Design and implementations; Infrastructure assets; Infrastructure development; scenarios; Decision making","Bridges, T.S., (2015) Use of Natural and Nature-based Features (NNBF) for Coastal Resilience, , ERDC SR-15-1.

Since many years, their recovery allowed the restoring of great amounts of metals for new cars' production. However, the management of electronic systems embedded into ELVs is yet rarely considered by the scientific literature. The purpose of the paper is trying to fill in this gap through the proposition of an innovative economic model able to identify the presence of profitability within the recovery process of automotive Waste Printed Circuit Boards (WPCBs). Net Present Value (NPV) and Discounted Payback Time (DPBT) will be used to demonstrate the validity of investments in this type of plants. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis on a set of critical variables (plant saturation level, gold (Au) content, Au market price, Au final purity level, WPCBs purchasing cost and opportunity cost) will be conducted for the evaluation of the impact of significant variations on results. Finally, the matching of predicted European ELVs volumes (during the period 2015-2030) and NPVs coming from the economic model will quantify the potential advantages coming from the implementation of this new kind of circular economy. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Sustainability will play a major role within the business and has an impact especially on the distant future. Thus, supply chain executives are challenged in designing sustainable supply chains for the future. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach - The authors develop expert-based scenarios, which describe how future supply chains could evolve by 2030. The authors focus on the transportation and logistics industry's perspective to provide an industry-internal view. The data collection is based on an internetbased Delphi survey. Overall, 48 top executives from 20 countries, representing academic, governmental, and industrial perspectives, participated in the survey. Findings - The authors operationalized the research question into five concrete sub-topics relevant for investigation: energy and emissions, consumer behaviour, future transport modes, design of future supply chains, and innovation. The authors derive five Delphi-based scenarios defined by clusters of their impact and expected probability: measurement and control of CO2-emissions; integrated low energy logistics systems; business-as-usual logistics; no-frills logistics and alternative fuels. Each cluster contributes differently to supply chain strategy. Originality/value - The authors address the major issues and challenges experts expect regarding future supply chains in an energy-constrained, low-carbon world. Five scenario clusters evolved for supply chain strategy development.

This was manifested by the way they were able to identify, understand and contrive possible explanations of their context specific problems through the language and insight provided by the six complexity principles. These results show that the knowledge transformation process initiated through interdependent learning about the 6 complexity science principles had a significant impact for case companies in terms of improving and increasing their problem solving capabilities. © 2005 IEEE.","complexity science; concurrent engineering; knowledge transformation; problem solving; uncertainty","Concurrent engineering; Industrial management; Complexity science; Explicit knowledge; Implicit knowledge; Knowledge transformation; Knowledge transformation process; Problem solving process; Specific problems; uncertainty; Problem solving","Beinhocker, E.D., Robust adaptive strategies in strategic thinking for the next economy (2001) MIT Sloan Management Review, pp. 131-153. , edited by Barry A Turner.

Design/methodology/approach – From a comprehensive review and synthesis of relevant literature and media coverage since 1980, the author identifies 42 cases of bet-the-company decisions, from which the conclusions are drawn. Findings – The author identify four characteristics, three distinct types and four drivers of bet-the-company decisions. Research limitations/implications – The author draws conclusions from a qualitative analysis of 42 cases mentioned in prominent business media, supplemented by a literature review. Identifying the underlying processes that result in betting the company would require a more in-depth series of case studies. Acquiring statistical evidence would require more formal meta-analysis that this paper lacks. Practical implications – The paper identifies common characteristics, types and drivers of bet-the-company decisions that decision-makers could use to judge to recognize whether they also face such a situation.

To achieve a better fit, the pricing and commercialisation of electric vehicles therefore have to be improved. This is only possible if the decision on the design of the new products is made on a sounder basis. However, this is particularly difficult in the case of really new products with which the customer is not yet familiar. This paper examines that better information about customers can be acquired by providing them with a better offering of information which has been prepared in a variety of forms (new method of interdependent 'information acceleration') and how management decisions can be improved as a result. A test studio was set up in the form of a Car Clinic for the example of a future electric vehicle. The results reveal that information acceleration in a test studio can improve the traditional approaches of linear acquisition of information about customers and therefore estimation of adequate pricing and commercialisation in an early decision-making phase and can have a positive influence on decision-making behaviour under uncertainty.

MCS can be instrumental in securing an organization’s strategic performance objectives, far beyond the mere managerial control and accounting perspectives of traditional MCS’ roles. Design/methodology/approach: This study is qualitative in nature, and presents a theoretical approach with a conceptual model to address enterprise flexibility and stability jointly; arguing that both should be part of the MCS’ design and implementation with a distinct strategic outlook. Several theoretical and practical arguments are presented which reinforce this thesis. Findings: To operate optimally, enterprises must be able to manage their limited resources in efficient and effective manner. This is especially so when dealing with uncertainty and contingencies on an ongoing basis, while following a defined strategic choice. Such choices are expected to mirror enterprise flexibility types and measures without neglecting enterprise stability requirements, linking both to strategic performance measurement indicators. Research limitations/implications: Further work is needed to explore not only how different types of enterprise flexibility and stability measures can bring additional benefits to the firm but also how best to apply such types in accordance with business and operations strategies, organizational stability requirements and management control strategies. Practical implications: MCS can and should take part of an organization’s strategic performance measures but these are to be understood from a systemic design perspective of the enterprise system’s metacontrollability, addressing flexibility and stability jointly. Social implications: There is a need to reevaluate the role of MCS and their strategic potential. The approach presented can have valuable potential ramifications and insights for management and information sciences as well as for the enterprise management practitioners as a whole. Originality/value: This paper provides original research on enterprise flexibility and stability analysis, covering all aspects of MC and its role on the enterprise’s metacontrollability. Design and coordination of the seven basic elements which comprise MCS are analyzed, as well as how they influence one another. The paper includes two tables to illustrate the approach being proposed. Table I presents a classification of the literature reviewed in the paper while Table AI presents the choice of the theoretical lens on enterprise flexibility from other authors which contrasts with the model proposed. The role of MCS in the enterprise is also included. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Flexibility; Management control systems; Metacontrollability; Performance measurement; Stability; Strategic options",,"Abernethy, M.A., Lillis, A.M., The impact of manufacturing flexibility on management control system design (1995) Accounting, Organizations and Society, 20 (4), pp. 241-258; Ahrens, T., Chapman, C.S., Accounting for flexibility and efficiency: a field study of management control systems in a restaurant chain* (2004) Contemporary Accounting Research, 21 (2), pp. 271-301; Anand, G., Ward, P.T., Fit, flexibility and performance in manufacturing: coping with dynamic environments (2004) Production and Operations Management, 13 (4), pp. 369-385; Anthony, R., Govindarajan, V., (2007) Management Control Systems, , Mc-Graw-Hill IRWIN, Chicago, I; Anthony, R.N., (1965) Management Accounting Principles, , Richard D.

It rethinks the way risk contributes to strategy, with insights relevant to practitioners and scholars in national security as well as business. Over the past few years, the concept of risk has become one of the most commonly discussed issues in national security planning. And yet the experiences of the 2007-2008 financial crisis demonstrated critical limitations in institutional efforts to control risk. The most elaborate and complex risk procedures could not cure skewed incentives, cognitive biases, groupthink, and a dozen other human factors that led companies to take excessive risk. By embracing risk management, the national security enterprise may be turning to a discipline just as it has been discredited. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2016.",,,"Abolafia, M.Y., Central Banking and the Triumph of Technical Rationality (2012) Handbook of the Sociology of Finance, pp. 94-114. , Katrin Knorr Cetina and Alex Preda (eds.), New York: Oxford University Press; Abolafia, M.Y., Narrative Construction as Sensemaking: How a Central Bank Thinks (2010) Organization Studies, 31 (3), pp. 349-367; Abolafia, M.Y., Framing Moves: Interpretive Politics at the Federal Reserve (2004) Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, 14 (3), pp. 349-370; Adams, J., (1995) Risk, , London: Routledge; Adams, J., Egg on Wall?

Neophytos Loizides examines how acrimoniously divided Cyprus has not managed to unify by adopting a federal and consociational arrangement. Loizides asserts that institutional innovation is key in designing peace processes. Analyzing power-sharing in Northern Ireland, the return of displaced persons in Bosnia, and the preparatory mandate referendum in South Africa, he shows how divided societies have implemented novel solutions despite conditions that initially seemed prohibitive. Turning to Cyprus, he chronicles the breakthrough that led to the exhumations of the missing after 2003, and observes that a society’s choice of narratives and institutions can overcome structural constraints. While Loizides points to the relative absence of successful federal and consociational arrangements among societies evolving from the ""post-Ottoman space,"" he argues that neither elites nor broader societies in the region must be held hostages to the past. To effect lasting and positive change, Loizides encourages stakeholders in divided societies to be prepared to identify, redesign, and implement innovative new institutions. Examining successful peace mediations and identifying the shared experience and commonalities between Cyprus and other divided societies promises not only to inform the tackling of the Cyprus problem but also to provide transferable knowledge with broader implications for the fields of peace studies and conflict resolution. © 2016 University of Pennsylvania Press.

A variety of foresight tools are in place to support top management's strategic decision-making. However, leaders cannot claim to have the full scope of knowledge and capabilities required for creating a long-term, robust and implementable strategy. Today, many experts with the relevant detailed knowledge about future developments and organisational capabilities can be found in middle management, which needs to be reflected in an integrative approach towards strategy development.In this paper, an approach is presented that describes how a foresight-based strategy development approach can be designed in order to leverage the potential of middle management. This approach is applied in strategy development to the supply chain management of a multinational manufacturing company. The case focuses on Asia, and includes 37 middle managers plus their staff - totalling approximately 70 employees - from 13 countries. The results indicate that top and middle management were willing to follow the highly structured process, contributing to strategy development in terms of ideas, data, time, resources and analytical work. The developed strategy integrated the middle management's perspective successfully and strategy implementation started immediately. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Corporate foresight; Middle management; Scenarios; Strategy development; Strategy-as-practice","Human resource management; Information management; Knowledge management; Planning; Supply chain management; Corporate foresight; Middle management; Scenarios; Strategy as practices; Strategy development; Decision making","Hutzschenreuther, T., Kleindienst, I., Strategy-process research: what have we learned and what is still to be explored (2006) J.

This research advances knowledge on the practice of foresight in long-term planning through a comparative analysis of planning approaches in two organisations linked through common ownership. Data generated from planning documentation and the foresight practice of strategy personnel in the two cases (transport and banking) provided support for a dynamic model of foresight integrated LT planning. The ongoing collection and synthesis of strong and weak signals, and their continual assimilation into scenarios depicting alternative futures was structurally supported by a community-of-practice. The community-of-practice widely engaged strategists located across organisational levels in conversations about emerging futures and about strategies through which to engage those futures. The findings encourage managers and researchers to view long-term planning as an ongoing interrogation of implemented and envisioned strategies within emerging, alternative futures. Such an approach stimulates strategic entrepreneurship and prepares the organisation for engaging in future environments. © 2013.","Community-of-practice; Foresight; Long-term planning","Technological forecasting; Community of practice; Comparative analysis; Foresight; Long term planning; Organisational level; Research advances; Strategic capability; Weak signals; Innovation","Bell, W., (2003) Foundations of Futures Studies: History, Purposes, and Knowledge, 1. , Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick, NJ, USA; Ofek, E., Wathieu, L., Are you ignoring trends that could shape up your business?

We define corporate foresight as a practice that permits an organization to lay the foundation for a future competitive advantage. Historically we distinguish and discuss four main phases: 1) birth of the field (1950s), 2) the age of scenarios (1960s-1970s), 3) professionalization (1980s-1990s), and 4) organizational integration (2000-). A systematic literature search revealed 102 articles on foresight, 29 of them on corporate foresight. Based on these articles and those in this Special Issue, we identify four main themes. Two more mature themes, namely 'organizing corporate foresight', and 'individual and collective cognition', and two emerging themes 'corporate foresight in networked organizations', and 'quantifying value contributions'. In the conclusion we make a plea for establishing corporate foresight as a separate research stream that can adopt various theoretical foundations from a number of general management research traditions. To help the field move forward we identify three areas in which corporate foresight research can build on theoretical notions in general management, and can contribute to such on-going debates. © 2015.","Corporate foresight; Historical development; Review; Strategic foresight","Innovation; Reviews; Technological forecasting; Collective cognition; Competitive advantage; Corporate foresight; General management; Historical development; Networked organizations; Strategic foresight; Theoretical foundations; Competition; corporate strategy; economic history; historical perspective; industrial development; literature review","Ahuja, G., Coff, R.W., Lee, P.M., Managerial foresight and attempted rent appropriation: insider trading on knowledge of imminent breakthroughs (2005) Strateg.

Several authors therefore recommend adaptive project management practices - sometimes named 'targeted flexibility' - that respond to project characteristics commonly found in innovation, namely novelty, complexity, speed and - as a result - uncertainty. This paper investigates how this proposed adaptation of project management occurs in a context with high levels of novelty that organizes work in projects and needs to accommodate projects of different pace, complexity and innovativeness: product development in small and medium enterprises that do research and development work in the same organizational unit. Results of a literature review and two exploratory studies, covering a total of 8 companies with multiple projects each, are presented. Implications for a future framework for targeted flexibility are developed, leading to the identification of the following needs for project management: (1) better understanding of the many ways in which project management impacts exploration and exploitation activities, (2) improved attention for the currently poorly supported pre-project and early initiation stages, (3) a shift of focus from monitoring against plans toward monitoring against achieved learning, and (4) the formulation of transition paths from current new product development practice to higher project management maturity. © 2014 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology.",,"Engineering research; Product development; Project management; Exploration and exploitation; Management maturities; New product development; Organizational units; Project characteristics; Project management practices; Research and development; Small and medium enterprise; Research and development management","Rice M P, J.G., O'Connor, G.C., Peters, L.S., Morone, Managing discontinuous innovation (1998) Res.

These tools are integrated into an approach that encompasses the discovery of change, interpretation, and triggering managerial responses. The overall system consists of a tool for scanning for weak signals on change (PEACOQ Scouting Tool), a tool for collecting internal ideas (PEACOQ Gate 0.5), and a tool for triggering organizational responses (Foresight Landing page). Particularly the link to innovation management and R&D strategy is discussed in detail. We further report on the value creation and lessons learned that have accumulated over the last eight years throughout which the tools and approach have been built gradually. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Corporate foresight; Innovation; IT tools; Scouting; Social networks; Web 2.0","Innovation; Technological forecasting; Corporate foresight; Deutsche telekom; Innovation management; Landing pages; Response systems; Scouting; Value creation; Web 2.0; Social networking (online)","Vecchiato, R., Environmental uncertainty, foresight and strategic decision making: an integrated study (2012) Technol.

One reason why executives may not take more decisive action on adaptation is the type of information they rely on for decision-making purposes. From this perspective, executives who engage more with scientific information sources for decision-making purposes would be likely to have a more comprehensive understanding of climate change, and would consequently be more concerned about their company’s vulnerability and adaptation needs. So far, however, there is limited evidence showing that executives’ lack of engagement with scientific information influences their perception that climate change is a serious issue. In this paper, we use survey data collected from 125 executives across the top 500 companies on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX-500) to examine the links between how executives obtain information on climate change and their perceived need for adaptation action. Findings show that executives who report greater engagement with scientific information express greater concern about their company’s vulnerability, which also translates into a greater perceived need for adaptation action. Making scientific information accessible to executives is therefore important for communicating climate science to a business audience. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,"Decision making; Adaptation needs; Adaptation to climate changes; Australian stock exchanges; Business community; Climate science; Decisive actions; Scientific information; Survey data; Climate change; climate change; climate modeling; decision making; industrial development; industrial policy; information management; perception; Australia","Climate change calling: BT CEO says climate change is a risk to UK (2013) Available at:, , http://www.acclimatise.uk.com/index.php?id=3&blog=521; Astley, W.G., van de Ven, A.H., Central perspectives and debates in organization theory (1983) Admin Sci Quart, 28, pp. 245-273; Baron, R.M., Kenny, D.A., The moderator–mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations (1986) J Pers Soc Psychol, 51, p. 1173; Bentler, P.M., Comparative fit indixes in structural models (1990) Psychol Bull, 107, pp. 238-246; Bentler, P.M., Bonett, D.G., Significance tests and goodness of fit in the analysis of covariance structures (1980) Psychol Bull, 88, pp. 588-606; Busch, T., Organizational adaptation to disruptions in the natural environment: the case of climate change (2011) Scand J Manag, 27, pp. 389-404; Byrne, B., (2010) Structural equation modeling with AMOS: basic concepts, applications, and pro- gramming, , Lawrence Erlbaum, Mahwah; Child, J., Organizational structure, environment and performance: the role of strategic choice (1972) Sociology, 6, 22p; Courtney, H., Kirkland, J., Viguerie, P., Strategy under uncertainty (1997) Harvard Bus Rev, 75, pp. 67-79; Ferguson, G., Mathur, S., Shah, B., Evolving from information to insight (2005) MIT Sloan Manag Rev, 46, pp. 51-58; Gardner, J., Parsons, R., Paxton, G., Adaptation benchmarking survey: Initial report (2010) CSIRO Climate Adaptation National Research Flagship; Ge, M., Helfert, M., Impact of information quality on supply chain decisions (2013) J Comput Inform Syst, 53, pp. 59-67; Goodall, A.H., Why have the leading journals in management (and other social sciences) failed to respond to climate change?

The first book of its kind, The Climate Resilient Organization assesses the issues that have mounted for decision-makers in the field, whilst providing strategies to tackle them. With a particular focus on building climate-resilient pathways for private sector organisations, the expert authors offer practical tools and decision-making criteria for evaluating adaptation needs, costs and benefits. Split into two parts this book begins with an analysis of the subject on a global scale; it continues by translating the science surrounding it while presenting it in a manner suited to local decision-makers. © Martina K.

So far, NP has been analyzed under uncertainty with probabilities or with partial information. The procedure described in the contribution is based on a hybrid of Hurwicz and Bayes decision rules. It takes into account the decision maker's attitude towards risk and the whole distribution of payoffs connected with particular order quantities.

Five characteristics of top management teams that influence a firm's export intensity were analyzed-educational level, functional heterogeneity, international exposure, age, and length of tenure with their current firm. The time period studied was 2007-2012, with a focus on these industries: rapidly changing consumer goods, automobiles, pharmaceuticals, and textiles. Most of the study's hypotheses were supported, and some of the results obtained differ from those found previously for developed markets. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Emerging markets; Export intensity; Top management team characteristics; Upper echelon",,"Abdellatif, M., Amann, B., Jaussaud, J., Family versus nonfamily business: A comparison of international strategies (2010) Journal of Family Business Strategy, 1 (2), pp. 108-116; Amason, A.C., Distinguishing the effects of functional and dysfunctional conflict on strategic decision making: Resolving a paradox for top management teams (1996) Academy of Management Journal, 39 (1), pp. 123-148; Amason, A.C., Shrader, R.C., Tompson, G.H., Newness and novelty: Relating top management team composition to new venture performance (2006) Journal of Business Venturing, 21 (1), pp. 125-148; Andersen, O., On the internationalization process of firms: A critical analysis (1993) Journal of International Business Studies, 24 (2), pp. 209-231; Baird, I.S., Thomas, H., Toward a contingency model of strategic risk taking (1985) Academy of Management Review, 10 (2), pp. 230-243; Bantel, K.A., Jackson, S.E., Top management and innovations in banking: Does the composition of the top team make a difference?

A company’s strategy defines its future direction, specifying its desired market position and key competitive advantages both at the level of market offers and of resources. This book provides clear, straight forward advice for professionals: After a brief introduction to strategic planning, a heuristic process for determining future strategies is presented. It shows how to analyze a company’s current situation, develop and assess options for the future, and define implementation projects. Throughout the book, detailed recommendations are illustrated with the help of numerous concrete examples. The book is a further development of the authors’ highly successful previous publication “Process-based Strategic Planning,” which appeared in six editions. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.",,,"Ansoff, H.I., (1965) Corporate strategy.

The challenge facing project managers in these complex, socio-technical environments is how to better understand the sources of project uncertainty and how to navigate a path through them in pursuit of successful project outcomes.This exploratory study analyses the literature on the management of uncertainty in projects using Söderlund's (2011) seven schools of thought on project management. Additionally it draws on interviews with project management practitioners from several large-scale projects in civil-nuclear and aerospace companies in the United Kingdom to posit the ""uncertainty kaleidoscope"" as a means of understanding the sources of uncertainty in safety-critical projects and identifies four conceptual approaches that may be adopted by project managers to attenuate the impact of uncertainty on the delivery of successful project outcomes. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd and International Project Management Association.","Managing uncertainty; Project uncertainty; Safety-critical","Managers; Project management; Safety engineering; Aerospace company; Conceptual approaches; Exploratory studies; Large-scale projects; Management of uncertainty; Managing uncertainty; Project uncertainty; Sources of uncertainty; Uncertainty analysis; conceptual framework; project assessment; project management; safety; uncertainty analysis; United Kingdom","Aaltonen, K., Project stakeholder analysis as an environmental interpretation process (2011) Int.

Design/methodology/approach: In China, a survey was administered to managers of SMEs in Shanghai and Guangzhou. In the USA, a survey was administered to managers of SMEs in three major cities. Competitive strategy, capabilities, uncertainty, and performance were measured by previously validated scales. Findings: Findings support the integrity Miles and Snow generic strategic typology. Performance satisfaction was significantly lower in firms employing a reactor strategy as opposed to those employing prospector, defender, or analyzer strategies. Additional support was found for the concept of strategic clarity, as businesses reporting moderate strategic clarity had lower levels of satisfaction with performance than those reporting either a single strategy or a combination emphasis on three equal strategies. Practical implications: Chinese SMEs tend to prefer cost-based approaches to their local markets. A differentiation market approach is challenging in most local Chinese economies due to the low wages of most jobs in an economy that is still largely centrally planned. In the USA, more disposable income leads to more market opportunities. While this situation is gradually changing in China, it is not at a point where SMEs feel comfortable pursuing totally differentiated strategies. Originality/value: Several distinctions in competitive strategy, capabilities, and environmental uncertainty between China and the USA are recognized by analysis. Analyzers and defenders in Chinese SMEs tend to follow industry prospectors with lower prices and/or superior service. They might change strategies after gaining a foothold in the market. Performance for SMEs with low strategic clarity often depends on established guanxi with governmental agencies or stated-owned enterprises, a situation very different from that in the USA. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Capabilities; China; Competitive strategy; Environment uncertainty; SMEs",,"Aguilar, F., (1967) Scanning the Business Environment, , MacMillan, New York, NY; Allen, R.S., Helms, M.M., Linking strategic practices and organizational performance to Porter's generic strategies (2006) Business Process Management Journal, 12, pp. 433-454; Assudani, R.H., What does it mean to management 'knowledge': Implications for the strategic management of knowledge in firms (2008) International Journal of Management & Decision Making, 9, pp. 646-659; Ayadi, O.G., Dufrene, U.B., Obi, C.P., Firm performance measurement: Temporal roadblock to innovation?

Discussions about energy often neglect important historical lessons about previous energy transformations and provide inadequate consideration of context - Driven by Demand takes a fresh approach by exploring the emergence of energy systems, outcomes and priorities. It outlines select historical and current events, challenges, and developing energy trends using a range of case studies. Readers will gain foundational knowledge about energy flows and end-uses, helping them to become more conversant about energy outcomes and priorities. This accessible book paves the way for broader discussions about societal resilience, privacy, and security concerns associated with the move towards 'smart' infrastructure. This is a must-read for business executives, policymakers and students working in energy policy, energy management and sustainable business. © Jimmy Y.

Progress however appears difficult to make as the private car, still largely fuelled by petrol or diesel, remains the mainstream mode of use. Transport is the key sector where carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions seem difficult to reduce. Transport, Climate Change and the City seeks to develop achievable and low transport CO2 emission futures in a range of international case studies, including in London, Oxfordshire, Delhi, Jinan and Auckland. The aim is that the scenarios as developed, and the consideration of implementation and governance issues, can help us plan for and achieve attractive future travel behaviours at the city level. The alternative is to continue with only incremental progress against CO2 reduction targets, to 'sleepwalk' into climate change difficulties, oil scarcity, a poor quality of life, and to continue with the high traffic casualty figures. The topic is thus critical, with transport viewed as central to the achievement of the sustainable city and reduced CO2 emissions. © 2014 Robin Hickman and David Banister.

Unfortunately, ""how-to"" knowledge is more directly actionable and indispensable for critical organizational activities such as strategic analysis and decision making. Knowledge management (KM) theorists often despair over ""how-to"" expertise as a form of tacit knowledge that is difficult to articulate, much less transfer. We argue that tacit strategic performance-based knowledge can often be captured and deployed effectively via frameworks that combine scenario planning methods with ""what-if"" simulation. The key challenges are two-fold: (1) modeling complex situational contexts, including known behavioral dynamics; and (2) enabling knowledge workers to manipulate such models interactively, to safely practice situational analysis and decision making, and learn from virtual rather real mistakes. We illustrate our approach with example knowledgebased decision support solutions and provide pointers to related literature. © 2008, IGI Global.",,,"Ambrosini, V., (2003) Tacit and Ambiguous Resources As Sources of Competitive Advantage, , New York, Palgrave Macmillan;

It raises the following question: what are the behavioral dynamics of real options in alliances? The systemic qualitative model we built from the study of an alliance formed by two competing firms around an R&D project revealed three sets of feedback structures (the ""expected flexibility"", ""uncertainty"" and ""collaborative skills and knowledge"" dynamics), in which are embedded three types of real growth options (that is, unexpected discovery, relational reputation and interactive options). While previous studies have often focused on how partners unilaterally manage real options to reduce uncertainty, our study allowed us to identify the real options created by the alliance, which can be exploited collectively, independently by each partner or not at all, and to capture their dynamic aspects. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Alliances; Influence diagram; Pharmaceutical project; Real options; System dynamics",,"Akerlof, A.G., The market for ""Lemons"": Quality uncertainty and the market mechanism (1970) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 84, pp. 488-500; Akkermans, H., Renga: A systems approach to facilitating inter-organizational network development (2001) System Dynamics Review, 17 (3), pp. 40-57; Amram, M., Kulatilaka, N., (1999) Real options: Managing strategic investment in an uncertain world, , Harvard Business School Press, Boston; Ariño, A., de la Torre, J., Learning from failure: Towards an evolutionary model of collaborative ventures (1998) Organization Science, 9 (3), pp. 306-325; Ariño, A., Doz, Y., Rescuing troubled alliances...Before it's too late (2000) European Management Journal, 18 (2), pp. 173-182; Axelrod, R., (1984) Evolution of cooperation, , Basic Books, New York; Bowman, E.H., Hurry, D., Strategy through the option lens: An integrated view of resource investments and the incremental-choice process (1993) Academy of Management Review, 18 (4), pp. 282-760; Bruner, R., Spekman, R., The dark side of alliances: Lessons from Volvo-Renault (1998) European Management Journal, 16 (2), pp. 136-150; Chen, L.-H., Hung, C.-C., An integrated fuzzy approach for the selection of outsourcing manufacturing partners in pharmaceutical R&D (2010) International Journal of Production Research, 48 (24), pp. 7483-7506; Cooke, D.L., Using system dynamics models to enhance the visualization of stochastic price processes (2004) Proceeding of the 22nd international conference of the system dynamics society, , Oxford, England; Courtney, H., Kirkland, J., Viguerie, P., Strategy under uncertainty (1997) Harvard Business Review (November-December), 75 (6), pp. 67-79; Crossan, M., Lane, H., White, R., An organizational learning framework: From intuition to institution (1999) Academy of Management Review, 24 (3), pp. 522-537; Crozier, M., Friedberg, E., (1977) L'acteur et le système: Les contraintes de l'action collective, , Le Seuil, Paris; Dalziel, M., Forgoing the flexibility of real options: When and why firms commit to investment decisions (2009) British Journal of Management, 20, pp. 401-412; Das, T.K., Kumar, R., Learning dynamics in the alliance development process (2007) Management Decision, 45 (4), pp. 684-707; Das, T.K., Teng, B., Risk types and inter-firm alliance structures (1996) Journal of Management Studies, 33 (6), pp. 827-843; Das, T.K., Teng, B.S., Instabilities of strategic alliances: An internal tensions perspective (2000) Organization Science, 11 (1), pp. 77-101; Dawes, R.M., Social dilemmas (1980) Annual Review of Psychology, 31, pp. 169-193; Diffenbach, J., Influence diagrams for complex strategic issues (1982) Strategic Management Journal, 3 (2), pp. 133-146; DiMasi, J.A., Hansen, R.W., Grabowski, H.G., The price of innovation: New estimates of drug development costs (2003) Journal of Health Economics, 22 (2), pp. 151-185; Dixit, A., Pindyck, R., (1994) Investment under uncertainty, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Doz, Y., Hamel, G., (1998) Alliance advantage, , Harvard Business School Press, Boston, Massachusetts; Dussauge, P., Garrette, B., Determinants of success in international strategic alliances: Evidence from the global aerospace industry (1995) Journal of International Business Studies, 26 (3), pp. 505-530; Dussauge, P., Garrette, B., Mitchell, W., Learning from competing partners: Outcomes and durations of scale and link alliances in Europe, North America and Asia (2000) Strategic Management Journal, 21, pp. 99-126; Duysters, G., Lokshin, B., Determinants of alliance portfolio complexity and its effect on innovative performance of companies (2011) Journal of Product Innovation Management, 28 (4), pp. 570-585; Dyer, H., Singh, H., The relational view: Cooperative strategy and sources of interorganizational competitive advantage (1998) Academy of Management Review, 23 (4), pp. 660-679; Eisenhardt, K.M., Building theories from case study research (1989) The Academy of Management Review, 14 (4), pp. 532-550; Folta, T., Governance and uncertainty: The trade-off between administrative control and commitment (1998) Strategic Management Journal, 19, pp. 1007-1028; Folta, T.B., Miller, K.D., Real options in equity partnerships (2002) Strategic Management Journal, 23, pp. 77-88; Ford, D., Sobek, S., Adapting real options to new product development by modelling the second Toyota paradox (2005) IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 52 (2), pp. 175-185; Forrester, J.W., (1975) Collected papers of Jay W.

Insight into changes in this structure is thus important for veterinary contingency planning.The objective of this paper was to explore changes in future production structure features within the cross-border region of the Netherlands (NL), North Rhine Westphalia (NRW) and Lower Saxony (LS) projected towards 2020 using the Policy Delphi method. Additionally, the findings of this study were elaborated in terms of possible implications for contagious livestock disease introduction, spread and control.Experts expected a sharp reduction in the number of farms, a sharp increase in farm size and regional concentration of livestock production, especially in NL. Increases in cross-border trade were expected, particularly in the pig sector, resulting in intensified mutual cross-border production dependency in most sectors. The cross-border region of NL-NRW-LS becomes, therefore, increasingly a single epidemiological area in which disease introduction is a shared veterinary and, consequently, economic risk. This situation results in increased need for collaboration among NL-NRW-LS to improve the joint prevention and control of contagious livestock diseases. It is concluded that veterinary policy makers should proactively anticipate these future changes in the production structure of livestock. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Contagious livestock disease control; Future prospects; Livestock production structure; Policy Delphi",,"DG Health and Consumers Management Plan 2012, , http://ec.europa.eu/atwork/synthesis/amp/doc/sanco_mp.pdf, Directorate General for Health & Consumers, Available at:, (Last accessed: 9 February 2012); Meuwissen, M.P.M., Horst, S.H., Huirne, R.B.M., Dijkhuizen, A.A., A model to estimate the financial consequences of classical swine fever outbreaks: principles and outcomes (1999) Prev.

The phase of development and the context-simple, complicated, or complex-dictate the most appropriate planning methodologies.

We argue that the divestiture activity of firms influences their acquisition behavior through corporate restructuring learning effects and enhanced strategic flexibility. These organizational spillovers affect not only the degree of risk acquirers are ready to take but also their ability to effectively negotiate with the target firm. We test the existence of organizational spillovers for an international sample of 4,795 acquirers for the period 1990-2008 and get support for our theoretical predictions.

Traditionally, foresight activities involves Delphi, focus group, or Estimate–Talk–Estimate techniques to collect opinions of an expert panel. Often, these techniques are not computerized and data visualization is rudimentary. Our highly-interactive FSS solves a number of inherent issues during the data collection, analysis, and results visualization processes. Despite that MCDM methods have been recommended for technology foresight, a validation with a real field experiment was still required. To evaluate our approach and FSS, we conducted a foresight exercise for the Swiss mobile payments market. Our research confirms that the use of MCDM methods supported with a computerized tool can enhance the foresight processes and results. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Foresight support systems; MCDM methods; Technology foresight",,"Aguilar, F., (1967) Scanning the business environment, , Macmillan, New York:; Bañuls, V.A., Salmeron, J.L., Scope and design issues in foresight support systems (2011) Int J Foresight Innov Policy, 7 (4), pp. 338-351; Basch, C., Focus group interview: an underutilized research technique for improving theory and practice in health education (1987) Health Educ Behav, 14 (4), pp. 411-448; Benayoun, R., Roy, B., Sussmann, B., Manuel de réference du programme electre.

Due to R&D budget constraints and limited resources, firms are often forced to select a subset of all candidate projects by means of project portfolio selection techniques mitigating the corresponding risks and enhancing the overall value of portfolio. Projects' interdependencies and types were rarely considered in existing models of R&D portfolio selection that may result in selecting wrong projects. This flaw hinders the projects alignment with corporate objectives and strategy and leads to excessive risk and missing the promised values. In this paper, a balanced set of R&D project evaluation criteria was proposed. Next, to construct R&D project portfolio, a 0-1 nonlinear mathematical programming method for balancing portfolio values and risks was proposed, in which research projects' interdependencies, types and other constraints were all considered. Finally, a Cross-Entropy algorithm was developed to solve the proposed model and results were reported. The algorithm proved to be very effective in terms of solution quality and computational time. The proposed algorithm especially suits large scale instances while exact approaches are doomed to fail. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Cross-Entropy (CE); Portfolio values; R&D project portfolio selection; Resource interdependencies; Risk analysis","Corporate objectives; Cross entropy; Nonlinear mathematical programming; Portfolio value; Project portfolio selection; Research and development; Resource interdependencies; Uncertain environments; Algorithms; Industry; Mathematical programming; Project management; Risk analysis; Research","Baker, N., Freeland, J., Recent advances in R&D benefit measurement and project selection methods (1975) Management Science, 21, pp. 1164-1175; Baker, N.R., Pound, W.H., R&D project selection (1964) IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, p. 11; Bard, J.F., Balachandra, R., Kaufmann, P.E., An interactive approach to R&D project selection and termination (1988) IEEE Transaction on Engineering Management, 35 (3), pp. 139-146; Blum, C., Roli, A., Metaheuristics in combinatorial optimization: Overview and conceptual comparison (2003) ACM Computing Surveys, 35 (3), pp. 268-308; Carlsson, C., Fuller, R., Heikkila, M., Majlender, P., A fuzzy approach to R&D project portfolio selection (2007) International Journal of Approximate Reasoning, 44, pp. 93-105; Casault, S., Groen, A.J., Linton, J.D., Selection of a portfolio of R&D projects (2013) Handbook on the Theory and Practice of Program Evaluation, Chapter 4, pp. 89-111. , Edward Elgar Publishing UK ISBN 9780857932396.

A total of 505 firms were surveyed, each had an innovation they were seeking to commercialise. Key issues examined were the firm's senior managers' perceptions of how supportive their country was to innovators in relation to government policy, the cost of doing business and the quality of communications infrastructure. Also examined was the ease of access to markets, skilled labour, research centres and external financing. The managers were also asked to indicate how much value they placed on outsiders such as accountants, venture financiers, customers, suppliers, lawyers and others in relation to their strategic decision making over commercialisation activities. Differences were found between the country sub-samples using discriminant analysis. However, the similarities between these firms suggest more commonality than differences. © 2014 Imperial College Press.","innovation climate; OECD; SMEs; strategy",,"Balzat, M., Hanusch, H., Recent trends in the research on national innovation systems (2004) Journal of Evolutionary Economics, 14 (2), pp. 197-210; Bavec, C., On the creative climate and innovativeness at the country level (2009) Zbornik Radova Ekonomskog Fakulteta U Rijeci, 27 (1), pp. 9-30; Birley, S., Westhead, P., A comparison of new businesses established by Novice, and Habitual, founders in Great Britain (1993) International Small Business Journal, 12 (10), pp. 38-60; Brown, S., Eisenhardt, K., Product development: Past research, present findings and future directions (1995) Academy of Management Review, 20 (2), pp. 343-378; Brown, S., Eisenhardt, K., (1998) Competing on the Edge: Strategy As Structured Chaos, , Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Press; Chakravorti, B., The new rules for bringing innovations to market (2004) Harvard Business Review, 82 (3), pp. 58-67; Choi, Y.-R., Shepherd, D.A., Entrepreneurs' decisions to exploit opportunities (2004) Journal of Management, 30 (6), pp. 377-395; Chrisman, J.J., McMullan, W.E., A preliminary assessment of outsider assistance as a knowledge resource: The longer-term impact of new venture counseling (2000) Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 24 (3), pp. 37-54; Chrisman, J.J., McMullan, W.E., Outsider assistance as a knowledge resource for new venture survival (2004) Journal of Small Business Management, 42 (3), pp. 229-244; Christensen, C.M., (1997) The Innovator's Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail, , Boston, MA: Presidents and Fellows of Harvard College; Courtney, H.G., Kirkland, J., Viguerie, S.P., Strategy under uncertainty (1997) Harvard Business Review, pp. 66-79. , November-December; Cronbach, L.J., Coefficient alpha and the internal structure of tests (1951) Psychometrica, 16 (3), pp. 297-334; Davidsson, P., Henrekson, M., Determinants of the prevalence of start-ups and high-growth firms (2002) Small Business Economics, 19 (2), pp. 81-104; Drucker, P., (1985) Innovation and Entrepreneurship, , Oxford, UK: Butterworth-Heinemann; Ekvall, G., Organizational climate for creativity and innovation (1996) European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology, 5 (1), pp. 105-123; Gonzalez-Roma, V., Peiro, J.M., Tordera, N., An examination of the antecedents and moderator influences of climate strength (2002) Journal of Applied Psychology, 87 (3), pp. 465-473; Grant, R.M., (2008) Contemporary Strategy Analysis, , 6th Edition.

This study investigates how culture impacts the decision to escalate or deescalate commitment to new products. Americans are analytic thinkers whereas Chinese tend to be holistic thinkers. When it comes to decision making, analytic thinkers focus on field independent and abstract factors and believe that future is linear and static, whereas holistic thinkers focus more on contextual factors and believe that future is dynamic and nonlinear. Hence, Chinese are more likely to escalate their commitment relative to Americans on receiving a negative performance report in the new product development process. A lab experiment using weekend MBA students and managers was used to test this underlying hypothesis. The findings confirmed that analytical thinkers use fewer factors than holistic thinkers in making new product decisions, and that Chinese managers are more likely to escalate their commitment relative to American managers. The decision to escalate or de-escalate was moderated by perceived product innovativeness. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","ANALYTIC-holistic thinking; Culture; Escalation of commitment; New product development",,"Abratt, R., van Altena Lombard, A., Determinants of product innovation in specialty chemical companies (1993) Industrial Marketing Management, 22 (3), pp. 161-254; Arkes, H.R., Blumer, C., The psychology of sunk cost (1985) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 35 (1), pp. 124-140; Boulding, W., Morgan, R., Staelin, R., Pulling the plug to stop the new product drain (1997) Journal of Marketing Research, 34 (1), pp. 164-176; Brockner, J., The escalation of commitment to a failing course of action: toward theoretical process (1992) Academy of Management Review, 17 (1), pp. 39-61; Brockner, J., Houser, R., Birnbaum, G., Lloyd, K., Deitcher, J., Nathanson, S., Escalation of commitment to an ineffective course of action: The effect of feedback having negative implications for self-identity (1986) Administrative Science Quarterly, 31 (1), pp. 109-126; Brockner, J., Rubin, J.Z., Lang, E., Face-saving and entrapment (1981) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 17 (1), pp. 68-79; Chen, J., Reilly, R.R., Lynn, G.S., The impact of speed-to-market on new product success: The moderating effects of uncertainty (2005) IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 52 (2), pp. 199-212; Choi, I., Nisbett, R.E., Norenzayan, A., Causal attribution across cultures: Variation and universality (1999) Psychological Bulletin, 125 (1), pp. 47-63; Churchill, G.A., Iacobucci, D., (2005) Marketing research: Methodological foundation, , South-Western, Mason, Ohio; Conlon, D.E., Garland, H., The role of project completion information in resource allocation decision (1993) Academy of Management Journal, 36 (2), pp. 402-413; Cook, T.D., Campbell, D.T., (1979) Quasi-experimentation: Design and analysis issues for field settings, , Rand McNally College Publishing Company, Chicago; Cooper, R.G., The dimensions of industrial new product success and failure (1979) Journal of Marketing, 43 (3), pp. 93-103; Cooper, L.P., A research agenda to reduce risk is new product development through knowledge management: A practitioner perspective (2003) Journal of Engineering and Technology Management, 20 (1-2), pp. 117-140; Cooper, R.G., Kleinschmidt, E.J., Resource allocation in the new product process (1988) Industrial Marketing Management, 17 (3), pp. 249-262; Cooper, R.G., Kleinschmidt, E.J., New product processes at leading industrial firms (1991) Industrial Marketing Management, 20 (2), pp. 137-147; Courtney, H., Kirkland, J., Viguerie, P., Strategy under uncertainty (1997) Harvard Business Review, pp. 67-79. , (November-December); Cousins, S.D., Culture and self-perception in Japan and the United States (1989) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 56 (1), pp. 124-131; De Brentani, U., Kleinschmidt, E.J., Corporate culture and commitment: Impact on performance of international new product development programs (2004) Journal of Product Innovation Management, 21 (5), pp. 309-333; Fisher, M.L., What is the right supply chain for your product?

Stakeholder objectives are often unclear due to highly exploratory business cases. Further ambiguity emerges from disagreement between stakeholders and decisionmakers called to formulate scientific, technological and policy requirements for new systems. This paper develops a structured approach, called the Delphi-based Systems Architecting Framework (DB-SAF), which has been conceived to develop recommendations to system architects concerned with the design of unprecedented large infrastructures for which objectives are ambiguous or unclear. The objectives of DB-SAF are to identify sources of ambiguity in the value proposition of a system architecture and the associated trade-space exploration, characterize and model sources of ambiguity, and assess the impact of requirement ambiguities on the architectural trade space. The proposed systems architecting approach is demonstrated in this paper through the assessment of a robotic Mars Sample Return Campaign, which serves as a test bed case study to describe the proposed methodology and to discuss its extension to other fields of engineering. The proposed framework integrates methods from systems engineering, computational systems architecting, multidisciplinary systems design and optimization, uncertainty modeling, utility theory, and social science research. It allows decision makers to visualize an architectural synthesis of aerospace systems, understanding adverse impacts of ambiguity, and supporting negotiations among stakeholders for efficient compromise in systems architecting. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Modeling and simulation; Project formulation; Requirements elicitation and management; Stakeholders ambiguity; Systems architecture","Model and simulation; Project formulation; Requirements elicitation; Stakeholders ambiguity; Systems architecture","Abbas, A.E., Constructing Multiattribute Utility Functions for Decision Analysis (2010) Tutorials in Operations Research; Adler, M., Ziglio, E., (1996) Gazing into the Oracle: The Delphi Method and Its Application to Social Policy and Public Health, , Jessica Kingsley Publishers, London; Bellman, R., Zadeh, L.A., Decision-making in a fuzzy environment (1970) Manage Sci, 17, pp. 141-164; Bellman, R.E., (1957) Dynamic Programming, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Biernacki, P., Waldorf, D., Snowball sampling - Problems and techniques of chain referral sampling (1981) Sociol Methods Res, 10, pp. 141-163; Booch, G., Rumbaugh, J., Jacobson, I., (1996) The Unified Modeling Language for Object-oriented Development, , Rational Software Corporation, Santa Clara, CA; Brandenburger, A.M., Nalebuff, B.J., The right game: Use game theory to shape strategy (1995) Harvard Bus Rev, 73, pp. 57-71; Browning, T.R., Fricke, E., Negele, H., Key concepts in modeling product development processes (2006) Syst Eng, 9, pp. 104-128; Camerer, C., Weber, M., Recent developments in modelling preferences: Uncertainty and ambiguity (1992) J Risk Uncertainty, 5, pp. 325-370; Cameron, B.G., Catanzaro, S., Crawley, E.F., Value based architecture selection Proceedings of the 57th International Astronautical Congress, Valencia, Spain, 2006; Courtney, H., Kirkland, J., Viguerie, P., Strategy under uncertainty (1997) Harvard Bus Rev, 75, pp. 66-79; Crawley, E.F., (2008) ESD.34 System Architecture - Lecture Notes, , Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA; De Neufville, R., De Weck, O., Frey, D., Hastings, D., Larson, R., Simchi-Levi, D., Oye, K., Welsch, R., Uncertainty management for engineering systems planning and design (2004) Proceedings of the Engineering Systems Symposium, , MIT, Cambridge, MA; De Weck, O.L., (2009) 16.842 Fundamentals of Systems Engineering - Lecture Notes, , MIT OpenCourseWare, Cambridge, MA; De Weck, O., De Neufville, R., Chaize, M., Staged deployment of communications satellite constellations in low Earth orbit (2004) J Aerospace Comput, Inform Commun, 1, pp. 119-136; Dori, D., Crawley, E.F., (2002) Object-process Methodology: A Holistics Systems Paradigm, , Springer Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany; Dyer, J.S., Fishburn, P.C., Steuer, R.E., Wallenius, J., Zionts, S., Multiple criteria decision making, multiattribute utility theory: The next ten years (1992) Manage Sci, 38, pp. 645-654; Edwards, W., The theory of decision making (1954) Psychol Bull, 51, pp. 380-417; Edwards, W., How to use multiattribute utility analysis for social decision making (1977) IEEE Trans Syst, Man, and Cybernet, 7, p. 326; Engel, A., Browning, T.R., Designing systems for adaptability by means of architecture options (2008) Syst Eng, 11, pp. 125-146; Fishburn, P.C., (1970) Utility Theory for Decision Making, , Research Analysis Corp., Mclean VA; Flick, U., (2009) An Introduction to Qualitative Research, 4th Edition, , SAGE Publications Ltd, London, UK; Forman, E.H., Gass, S.I., The analytical hierarchy process-An exposition (2001) Oper Res, 49, pp. 469-487; Fricke, E., Schulz, A.P., Design for changeability (DfC): Principles to enable changes in systems throughout their entire lifecycle (2005) Syst Eng, 8, pp. 342-359; Glaser, B.G., Strauss, A., (1967) The Discovery of Grounded Theory: Strategies for Qualitative Research, , Aldine Publishing Co., Piscataway, NJ; Gooding, J.L., Arvidson, R.E., Zolotov, M.I., Physical and chemical weathering (1992) Mars, A93-27852, pp. 626-651; Harremoes, P., (2001) Late Lessons from Early Warnings: Precautionary Principle 1896-2000, , European Environment Agency, Copenhagen, Denmark; Hastings, D.E., Weigel, A.L., Walton, M.A., Incorporating uncertainty into conceptual design of space system architectures (2002) Proceedings of the ESD Internal Symposium, , Working Paper Series, May 29-30; Hermanns, H., Interviewing as an activity (2004) A Companion to Qualitative Research, pp. 203-208. , U.

This is a question that is more pertinent than ever, as countries across the Asia-Pacific are faced with the military and economic rise of China. Uncertainty is inherent in defence planning, but different types of uncertainty mean that countries need to approach decisions about military force structure in different ways. This book examines four different basic frameworks for defence planning, and demonstrates how states can make decisions coherently about the structure and posture of their defence forces despite strategic uncertainty. It draws on case studies from the United States, Australian and New Zealand, each of which developed key concepts for their particular circumstances and risk perception in Asia. Success as well as failure in developing coherent defence planning frameworks holds lessons for the United States and other countries as they consider how best to structure their military forces for the uncertain challenges of the future. © 2014 Stephan Frühling.",,,"Ackerman, S., Despite Asia Talk, Navy Will Send Newest Ships to Mideast (2012) Wired, , www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/06/navy-new-ships-mideast/, 27 June (accessed 30 November 2012); Advisory Council on Global Change, (2000) World in Transition: Strategies for Managing Global Environmental Risks, , Berlin: Springer; Amran, M., Kulatilaka, N., (1999) Real Options: Managing Strategic Investment in an Uncertain World, , Boston: Harvard Business School Press; Anderson, K., Dibb, P., Strategic Guidelines for Enabling Research and Development to Support Australian Defence (1996) Canberra Paper, (115). , Canberra: Strategic and Defence Studies Centre, Australian National University; Andrews, E., (2001) The Australian Centenary History of Defence, Vol. V: The Department of Defence, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Angevine, R.G., Hiding in Plain Sight: The U.S. Navy and Dispersed Operations under EMCON, 1956-1972 (2011) Naval War College Review, 64 (2), pp. 79-95; Army Transformation Office, (2004) United States Army: 2004 Army Transformation Roadmap, , Washington DC: Department of Defense; Aspin, L., (1993) Report on the Bottom-Up Review, , Washington DC: Department of Defense; Association of the United States Army, 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review: Shifting Emphasis (2006) Defense Report, , March; General, A., Army Presence in the North (1997) Audit Report, (27). , Canberra: National Audit Office; Aven, T., Renn, O., On Risk Defined as an Event where the Outcome is Uncertain (2009) Journal of Risk Research, 12 (1), pp. 1-11; Axe, D., Bombs Away: How the Air Force Sold Its Risky New $55 Billion Plane (2012) Wired, , www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/03/airforce-bomber-gamble/, 26 March, (accessed 28 November 2012); Ayson, R., Australasian Security Policy: Old Agenda Divergence, New Agenda Convergence?

This paper builds on literature calling attention to the educational need for pedagogically addressing the implications of the intensifying complexity in the environments that confront adults in their professional and personal lives. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: Three theoretical streams, (a) Complex adaptive systems; (b) learning through experience; and, (c) adult developmental theory provide the basis for the pedagogical approach that is presented. The focus is on contingently applying these distinct streams of theory into learning designs. We share our experiences in experimenting with course designs for preparing adult learners for taking action on personal, civic, and professional challenges embedded in ambiguity and uncertainty in which rigid application of ready-made solutions is not possible. Our goal is to stimulate deeper experimentation. Accordingly, the question guiding this paper is, ""How can we as adult educators create conditions in our classrooms, and other learning venues, for addressing the need for preparing adults to mindfully learn through the challenges that confront them in the context of increasing complexity?"" Setting: For purposes of illustrating our experience and provoking questions, we draw on examples from our work in three graduate level courses in distinct disciplinary settings-specifically, organizational psychology and adult learning, adult education, and technology management.Research Design: This paper is an analytical essay drawing out the implications for generative learning from an integrative literature review connecting the three theoretical streams identified above that guide our thinking and work. We provide a framework for creating generative learning spaces based on the implications drawn from this integrative literature review, along with examples of application. Conclusions/Recommendations: Our experiences in a range of settings suggests that applying the framework can provide educative structures in which adults may stretch their capacity to make meaning, and learn how make choices for timely action, under conditions of uncertainty and ambiguity generated by the complexity their socio-economic environments. The approach also provokes new challenges for faculty as well as students, challenges that require more systemic research. We conclude with an agenda for future research. © by Teachers College, Columbia University.",,,"Alverson, M., Sköldberg, K., (2004) Reflexive Methodology: New Vistas for Qualitative Research, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Argyris, C., Schön, D.A., (1975) Theory in practice: Increasing professional effectiveness, , San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass; Basseches, M.A., (1984) Dialectical thinking and adult development, , New York, NY: Ablex; Bateson, G., (1972) Steps to an ecology of mind, , New York, NY: Ballantine Books; Boulton, J., Allen, P., Complexity perspective (2007) Advanced Strategic Management, , In V.

In isolation, the breadth and the depth have been widely discussed in the existing business literature, but their relationships remain unknown. This study explores how the breadth and depth interact with each other to affect firm performance. Evidence collected in this study shows that the interaction effect is positive and significant when the level of both breadth and depth is moderate. When either dimension increases further, the interaction effect is still positive and grows even more significant. However, the positive and significant effect reverses and becomes negative (although non-significant) when a high level of both dimensions is reached. These relationships suggest that the adoption of an international diversification strategy should take into consideration breadth and depth simultaneously as they affect each other mutually in determining firm performance.

It aims to create a dynamic performance framework based on the utilization of synergy effects of selected European and Asian management systems (Bata Management System, Japanese Management System and Amoeba Management System). The framework integrates basic elements that enable every aspect of the company (people, processes and systems, innovations, finance, social responsibility and ecology) to be monitored. Special emphasis is put on customers and innovations as a fundamental basis of competitiveness for firms while continually improving the quality of processes and products. Mutual synergy effects of these elements shall ensure fast communication, build lasting value not only for the company, but also for customers and employees and improve corporate performance and efficiency. All perspectives are fully integrated with each other and create a framework that is periodical, dynamic and competitive and that is able to withstand irrelevant disturbances and that is at the same time responsive to relevant changes. © 2013 - IOS Press and the authors.

A nine-step process framework is presented following a review of extant literature. The framework provides a way to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate one or more vignettes (potential future utility infrastructure solutions) by examining: 1. Alternative scenario contexts; 2. User utility service requirements; 3. Technologies' readiness; 4. Knowledge of each technology life cycle stage; 5. Criticality of technologies to user requirements; 6. Interdependencies between technologies. The framework is based on collecting multiple expert contributions in order to arrive at a comparative evaluation. We use the 'city blood' vignette, which represents an infrastructure system delivering hydrogen enriched water, to apply the framework to two radically different scenario contexts. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Risk; Scenario; Technology; Uncertainty; Utility conversion; Vignette","future prospect; hydrogen; life cycle; literature review; risk assessment; technology; water","Camci, F., Ulanicki, B., Boxall, J., Chitchyan, R., Varga, L., Karaca, F., Rethinking future of utilities: supplying all services through one sustainable utility infrastructure (2012) Environmental Science and Technology, 46, pp. 5271-5272; Karaca, F., Raven, P., Machell, J., Varga, L., Camci, F., Chitchyan, R., Boxall, J., Janus, T., Single infrastructure utility provision to households: technological feasibility study (2013) Futures, 49, pp. 35-48. , May; Strzelecka, A., Skworcow, P., Modelling and simulation of utility service provision for sustainable communities (2012) International Journal of Electronics and Telecommunications, 58 (4), pp. 389-396; Sollie, P., Ethics, technology development and uncertainty: an outline for any future ethics of technology (2007) Journal of Information, Communication & Ethics in Society, 5 (4), pp. 293-306; Hansson, S.O., Coping with the unpredictable effects of future technologies (2011) Philosophy & Technology, 24 (2), pp. 137-149; Hellström, T., New vistas for technology and risk assessment?

Business risk is fundamental to the long term success of a company and the achievement of its goals. Risks can be classified in various ways. There are basic categories of risk such as systemic risk, market risk, production risk, etc. Enterprises can substantially eliminate a certain part of the risk, although some risks cannot be controlled by the company. The financial crisis has had a major impact on the success of firms. This crisis was due to the mortgage crisis in the U.S. In order to verify the relevance of the chosen measures for crisis management, a survey has been carried out in the Czech Republic.

Design/methodology/approach: The research was conducted within the scope of an interdisciplinary foresight conference, where a group of 216 renowned persons from 16 countries in business, academia and politics discussed policies and strategies for the future role of logistics as an enabler and driver of global wealth. Attendants were asked to share their visions of the future via a real-time Delphi study. The results were further discussed in futures workshops according to World Café methodology for group dialog. Findings: Based on extensive desk research of scenario studies, expert workshops, and creative sessions, the authors developed 20 key Delphi projections for global logistics in 2025. Experts were asked to rate the projection's probability, impact, and desirability as well as to provide reasons for all answers via the Delphi online-portal. Key topics of the Delphi-based scenarios include global health care supply chains, resource logistics (urban mining), water transportation, energy supply, and education. Moreover, the authors analysed discontinuities in global logistics, such as pandemics, conflicts, and resource crises. Originality/value: The increasing impact of logistics on a nation's and company's success underlines the importance of future-oriented and sustainable planning in this field. With this research endeavor, the authors provide insights in action needed to be taken by industry, politics and academia in order to leverage the full potentials of logistics and support the economic development of the world. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Change; Delphi; Globalization; Logistics; Sustainability; Wealth",,"Ansoff, H.I., Avner, J., Brandenburg, R.G., Partner, F.E., Radosevich, R., Does planning pay?

However, the characterization of fleet evolution and composition with scenarios has received only modest attention. The state of the art includes numerous depictions of the future fleet that lack in realism, plausibility, and relation to past history. This work reviews previous work on the matter, and presents a comprehensive analysis of historical aircraft production data from which a foundational fleet evolution model is proposed. A process for fleet scenario generation using the foundational model is formulated and illustrated with a representative example. This process involves the development of high-level scenario narratives with a well-accepted technique, and the definition details for the composition and evolution of the fleet.",,"Aircraft production; Aircraft technology; Comprehensive analysis; Current practices; Environmental benefits; Evolution modeling; Scenario development; Scenario generation; Aviation; Environmental technology","Byars, L.L., (1991) Strategic Management - Formulation and Implementation, , Harper Collings Publishers, 3rd ed; Gayoso, R.W., Seeing the Future through New Eyes (2008) The Failure of Strategic Planning and Corporate Performance, pp. 179-198. , Bethesda, MD, U.S.A.: World Future Society; Schoemaker, P.J.H., Scenario planning: A tool for strategic thinking (1995) Sloan Management Review, 36, pp. 25-39. , April; Schoemaker, P.J.H., When and How to Use Scenario Planning: A Heuristic Approach with Illustration (1991) Journal of Forecasting, 10, pp. 549-564; Coates, J.F., Scenario Planning (2000) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 65, pp. 115-123; Godet, M., (1987) Scenarios and Strategic Management, , Buttersworth, London; Courtney, H., Kirkland, J., Viguerie, P., Strategy Under Uncertainty (1997) Harvard Business Review, pp. 67-79. , Nov-Dec; Courtney, H., Decision-driver Scenarios for Assessing Four Levels of Uncertainty (2003) Strategy & Leadership, 31 (1), pp. 14-22; Pomerol, J.-C., Scenario Development and Practical Decision Making under Uncertainty (2001) Decision Support Systems, (21), pp. 197-204; Ducos, G.F., Two Complementary Cross-Impact Models, MIP1 and MIP2 (1980) Futures, pp. 405-419. , October; Helmer, O., Cross-Impact Gaming (1972) Futures, pp. 149-167. , June; Duperrin, J.C., Godet, M., SMIC 74 - A Method for Constructing and Ranking Scenarios (1975) Futures, pp. 302-312. , August; Hollinger, K.V., US Air Transport Fleet Forecast 2007 - 2035, , 2007 The MITRE Corporation.

The hotel sector in Turkey's hospitality industry is investigated. Generic strategies were self-reported with regard to typologies develop by Porter, and Miles and Snow. Partial support was found for direct linkages between environmental uncertainty and both financial and non-financial performance. Defenders exhibited the highest value in competitive uncertainty, but the difference was not significant. Prospectors, analyzers, and defenders outperformed reactors in terms of both financial and non-financial performance. Overall, defender/cost leadership and prospector/focus strategies appear to be the best options for Turkish hotels. Following Porter's admonition, hotels in Turkey seeking to combine low cost and differentiation approaches are likely to end up ""stuck in the middle.""

Executives in 111 Turkish hotels attached greater importance to market and market-linking capabilities than other capabilities. The generic strategy employed per the Miles and Snow typology was associated with differences in all the capabilities, with the greatest disparities seen among defenders. Although hotels tend to adopt the cost-leadership approach, differentiation was also associated with capability development, particularly in marketing, technology, management, and market-linking capabilities. A significant and positive relationship was found between environmental uncertainties and capabilities, and between capabilities and both financial and non-financial performance. Results demonstrated no differences between each of strategic capabilities and hotel characteristics such as star rating, hotel scale, work time, global alliances, and ownership. Implications for managers and future research are discussed.

We focus on two forms of digital strategy: general IT investment and IT outsourcing investment. Drawing from prior literature on determinants of IT activity and competitive dynamics, we argue that three elements of the industry environment determine whether digital strategic posture has an increasingly convergent or divergent influence on digital business strategy. By divergent influence, we mean an influence that leads to spending substantially more or less on a particular strategic activity than industry norms. We predict that a digital strategic posture (difference from the industry mean) has an increasingly divergent effect on digital business strategy under higher industry turbulence, while having an increasingly convergent effect on digital business strategy under higher industry concentration and higher industry growth. The study uses archival data for 400 U.S.-based firms from 1999 to 2006. Our findings imply that digital business strategy is not solely a matter of optimizing firm operations internally or of responding to one or two focal competitors, but also arises strikingly from awareness and responsiveness to the digital business competitive environment. Collectively, the findings provide insights on how strategic posture and industry environment influence firms' digital business strategy.","Digital business strategy; Industry competition; Industry environment; Industry growth; Industry turbulence; IT investments; IT strategy; Strategic posture","Digital business strategy; Industry competitions; Industry environment; Industry growth; IT investments; IT strategies; Strategic posture; Competition; Economics; Investments; Strategic planning; Turbulence; Industry","Aldrich, H.E., (1979) Organizations and Environments, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall; Ang, S., Straub, D.W., Production and transaction economies and IS outsourcing: A study of the U.

Design/methodology/approach: Using a commonly identified set of opinions (pending decisions, actors of influence, persistent trends, a surprise-free scenario, and two critical uncertainties), participants were divided into two sub-groups, each of which developed a set of scenarios. Sub-group A articulated futures that described how the critical uncertainties might emerge. Sub-group B articulated futures that described what might follow if the same critical uncertainties developed. Findings: Sub-group A believed their individual scenarios were slightly more logically comprehensible and that their set of scenarios better captured the range of concerns relevant to their pending decisions. Additionally, Sub-group B scored the jointly created surprise-free scenario to be less logically comprehensible than Sub-group A. Practical implications: This article suggests that some managers may find it challenging to see the relevance in temporally distant and uncertain futures into their decision-making activities. Therefore, those involved in strategic planning may find it productive to connect these uncertain futures to the present. Originality/value: This experiment contributes empirical support to the importance of connecting future events to the present day for engaging scenario users. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Critical uncertainties; Decision making; Future time horizons; Managers; Scenario methodology",,"Alson, A., Oner, M.A., An integrated view of foresight: Integrated foresight management model (2003) Foresight, 5 (2), pp. 33-45; Amara, R., Lipinski, A.J., (1983) Business Planning for an Uncertain Future, , Pergamon Press, New York, NY; Armsteus, M., Managerial foresight: Concept and measurement (2008) Foresight, 19 (1), pp. 53-66; Armsteus, M., Managerial foresight: Measurement scale and estimation (2011) Foresight, 13 (1), pp. 58-76; Bell, W., (1996) Foundations of Futures Studies, 1, pp. 265-269. , Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick, NJ; Burke, K., (1969) A Grammar of Motives, , University of California Press, Berkeley, CA; Cohen, J., (1988) Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences, , Lawrence Erlbaum, Hillsdale, NJ, 2nd ed; Connolly, T., Arkes, H.R., Hammond, K.R., (2000) Judgment and Decision Making: An Interdisciplinary Reader, , (Eds), Cambridge University Press, 2nd ed; Courtney, H., Kirkland, J., Viguerie, P., Strategy under uncertainty (1997) Harvard Business Review, 75 (6), pp. 67-79; Das, T.K., Time: The hidden dimension in strategic planning (1991) Long Range Planning, 24 (3), pp. 49-57; Das, T.K., Strategy and time: Really recognizing the future (2004) Managing the Future: Foresight in the Knowledge Economy, pp. 58-74. , Tsoukas, H., Shepherd, J.

There is much evidence that suggests that the current very high level of volatilities in the business world is going to get worse in the years and decades to come. This trend of increasing uncertainties and the resulting risks for businesses, demands a strategic-level attention to risk management. This strategic-level attention is warranted by the fact that proper risk management capabilities can lead to competitive advantage. Design/methodology/approach: The work is conceptual in its approach. The paper also provides many examples from a wide range of industries, as well as the results from other research works to support the finding of the paper. Findings: The paper first shows how firms' perspective of risk management is evolving. It then characterizes the main drivers behind the trend of increasing uncertainties in the business world which results in higher levels of risk exposure for companies. Finally, the paper characterizes four different ways through which proper risk management capabilities can lead to competitive advantage (depending on different risk categories). Originality/value: Although the importance of risk management and its potential strategic role has been widely studied in the literature, the question of how risk management capabilities can turn into a competitive advantage has received less attention. The answer to this question might help firms to better understand the strategic role of risk management and the importance of developing a proper set of risk management capabilities.

We argue that what distinguishes successful from unsuccessful entrepreneurs is precisely that the former vary their decision-making styles, sometimes relying on heuristics and sometimes relying on systematic analysis. In our proposed framework, successful entrepreneurs assess their level of expertise and the level of ambiguity in a particular decision context and then tailor their decision-making process to reduce risk. © The Author(s) 2012.","entrepreneurial decision making; entrepreneurial risk taking; new ventures; performance; theory",,"Allinson, C.W., Chell, E., Hayes, J., Intuition and entrepreneurial behaviour (2000) European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology, 9 (1), pp. 31-43; Armstrong, J.S., The value of formal planning for strategic decisions: Review of empirical research (1982) Strategic Management Journal, 3 (3), pp. 197-211; Baker, T., Miner, A., Eesley, D.T., Fake it until you make it: Improvisation and new ventures (2001) Babson College Entrepreneurship Research Conference, , Paper presented at the, Babson Park, MA; Baron, R.A., The cognitive perspective: A valuable tool for answering entrepreneurship's basic ""why"" questions (2004) Journal of Business Venturing, 19 (2), pp. 221-239; Berman, J.A., Gordon, D.D., Sussman, G., A study to determine the benefits small business firms derive from sophisticated planning versus less sophisticated types of planning (1997) Journal of Business and Economic Studies, 3 (3), pp. 1-11; Bhide, A., How entrepreneurs craft strategies that work (1994) Harvard Business Review, 72 (2), pp. 150-161; Bhide, A., (2000) The Origin and Evolution of New Businesses, , New York: Oxford University Press; Bourgeois, L.J., Eisenhardt, K.M., Strategic decision processes in Silicon Valley: The anatomy of a 'living dead (1987) California Management Review, 30 (1), pp. 143-159; Brinckmann, J., Grichnik, D., Kapsa, D., Should entrepreneurs plan or just storm the castle?

The increase in emphasis involves the ongoing evolution of action learning programmes extending the practice in response to new demands and challenges confronting both individuals and organisations embedded in societal changes. More specifically, this paper makes the case for and discusses this application of critical reflection and experiential learning as pedagogical components in professional graduate schools. One such application is described in detail to illustrate the potential of this pedagogical adaptation as a contribution to the conversation about utilising action learning in the education setting.

However, when the basis of competition shifts from product features to an experience delivered by a network of independently acting participants in a complex and fast-evolving market environment, approaches based on command and control do not work. For order to emerge from such chaos and to gain more control over success, strategy based on reason alone is not enough to inspire action in others. To understand what it takes to effectively make strategy under such circumstances, this article shows how the UK's Royal Marines, in collaboration with more than a dozen different stakeholder groups, developed a novel adaptation of wargaming to affect strategic change in Afghanistan. It also demonstrates the broad applicability of this strategic approach. © 2013 by The Regents of the University of California.

In particular, the study seeks relationships between preparations in organisational crisis-oriented functions (crisis readiness), applied strategy (represented by strategy typologies), and perceived performance. In addition, the study investigates if crisis readiness varies depending on the demographic properties of organisations. The findings clearly indicate a relationship between crisis readiness and strategy typology, namely cost leadership, differentiation and focus. In addition, Turkish hotel firms classified as reactors exhibit a higher level of crisis readiness than defenders, analyser and prospectors; moreover, a significant difference exists between reactors and prospectors. Significant relationships between crisis readiness and financial performance and crisis readiness and non-financial performance are found. However, a hypothesis concerning crisis readiness differences among hotels with respect to organisational demographics is not supported. © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","crisis management; crisis readiness; emergency management; emergency preparedness; hotel industry; strategic management; strategic orientation; tourism; Turkey",,"Acquaah, M., Yasai-Ardekani, M., Does the implementation of a combination competitive strategy yield incremental performance benefits A new perspective from a transition economy in Sub-Saharan Africa (2008) Journal of Business Research, 61 (4), pp. 346-354; Akkemik, K.A., (2011) Assessing the Importance of International Tourism for the Turkish Economy: A Social Accounting Matrix Analysis, , Tourism Management 2011 doi:10.1016/j.tourman.2011.09.002; Aldehayyat, J.S., Organisational characteristics and the practice of strategic planning in Jordanian hotels (2011) International Journal of Hospitality Management, 30 (1), pp. 192-199; Alonso-Almeidab, M.M., Bremsera, K., Strategic responses of the Spanish hospitality sector to the financial crisis International Journal of Hospitality Management, , press; Alpay, G., Bodur, M., Ylmaz, C., Cetinkaya, S., Arkan, L., Performance implications of institutionalization process in family-owned businesses: Evidence from an emerging economy (2008) Journal of World Business, 43 (4), pp. 435-448; Altinay, L., The relationship between an entrepreneur's culture and the entrepreneurial behavior of the firm (2008) Journal of Small Business and Enterprise Development, 15 (1), pp. 111-129; Arpan, L.M., Sun, H., The effect of country on origin on judgments of multinational organizations involved in a crisis (2006) Journal of Promotion Management, 12 (3-4), pp. 189-214. , DOI 10.1300/J057v12n03-11; Avci, U., Madanoglu, M., Okumus, F., (2011) Strategic Orientation and Performance of Tourism Firms: Evidence from A Developing Country, 32 (1), pp. 147-157. , Tourism Management; Aydoan, E., Orhan, F., Naldöken Beylik, U., Aksay, K., Salk kurumlarnda örgütsel örenme kapasitesi: Bir kamu hastanesi örnei (2011) C.Ü.

The problem with this is the social and technical complexities involved, and the absence of a shared understanding of the challenge and the scope of integrated solutions. It is necessary to clarify the contributions and interactions between disciplines in order to achieve integrated planning and design of SUDS. This paper reviews the literature across disciplinary fields and outlines key messages and uncertainties within each discipline. The outcome is a framework comprising time, space and human values, as well as biophysical processes (e.g. engineering), spatial strategies (e.g. urban design) and adaptive strategies (e.g. management). It identifies the planning of SUDS as a collective learning process with continuous iterations between disciplines, while also reflecting the past, present and future of a specific site. © IWA Publishing 2012.","Decision-making; Integrated planning; Interdisciplinarity; Stormwater",,"Agarwal, C., Green, G.M., Grove, J.M., Evans, T.P., Schweik, C.M., A review and assessment of land-use change models: Dynamics of space, time, and human choice (2002) General Technical Report NE-297, U.S. Department of Agriculture, , http://nrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/gtr/gtr_ne297.pdf, Forest Service, Northeastern Research Station.

The survey consisted of thirteen projections for the year 2020, ranging from positive statements, such as ""The church will experience a fresh, historic outpouring of the Holy Spirit,"" to negative ones, such as ""There will be an increase of public moral failures among Spirit-empowered leaders."" Of the 132 members invited, 29 percent, or 38 participants completed the survey. Participants reached a consensus on eight of thirteen projections. The results show that Empowered21 leaders have high expectations for 2020 - that the church would experience a historic outpouring of the Holy Spirit, sustained by new leadership. Yet, this would be accompanied by an increasing divide between how emerging and established generations express their Spirit-empowered faith. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.","Delphi method; empirical survey; foresight; Pentecostal leaders",,"http://www.weforum.org/issues/industry-scenariosGary, J.E., Toward a new macrohistory: An extension to sardar's 'postnormal times (2011) Futures, 43 (1), pp. 48-51. , February; Sanders, T.I., Strategic thinking and the new science: Planning in the midst of chaos (1998) Complexity, and Change, 111. , New York: Free Press; Yong, A., (2005) The Spirit Poured Out on All Flesh: Pentecostalism and the Possibility of Global Theology, 10. , Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic; Anderson, A., (2010) Studying Global Pentecostalism: Theories and Methods, , Berkeley: University of California Press; (2006) Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life Spirit and Power: A 10-Country Survey of Pentecostals, , http://pewforum.org/Christian/Evangelical-Protestant-Churches/ Spirit-and-Power-A-10-Country-Survey-of-Pentecostals(5)aspx, Washington DC October 5; Poloma, M.M., Pentecostal prayer within the assemblies of god: An empirical study (2009) Pneuma, 31 (1), pp. 47-65; Wilson, B., http://www.empowered21.comJohnson, T.M., The global demographics of the pentecostal and charismatic renewal (2009) Social Science and Modern Society, 46 (6), pp. 479-483. , November-December; Johnson, T.M., The global demographics of the pentecostal and charismatic renewal Spirit and Power: The Growth and Global Impact of Pentecostalism, , ed.

Increasing economic volatility has compounded the complexity of decisions that O&G companies must make in selecting and investing in projects. Consequently, managerial toolkits to support decisions on economic viability of investments under uncertainty have proliferated, from established traditional models such as Discounted Cashflow Analysis (DCA), to more contemporary ones such as Real Options Valuation (ROV). A comprehensive literature review of the Decision Analysis tools used in upstream asset valuations was performed, and identified tools were mapped to a conceptual decision analysis framework. Perceived value and popularity of these tools were established by conducting a broad survey which attracted 308 respondents over a two-month period. The survey results indicate that the tools can be grouped into three broad categories: tools with universal acceptance; tools that are not embraced by the O&G industry; and tools with partial acceptance. The survey also included several demographics dimensions. Several tools exhibited an increasing trend in utilization with increasing company size, while others indicated a functional silo effect where tools' acceptance levels varied considerably across job functions. Geographical impacts were not analyzed in detail as the sample space was skewed towards Europe and North America. Utilization and satisfaction levels are generally well correlated; however, a cross-analysis of these two dimensions indicates that discrepancies do exist. Hydrocarbon price forecasting and cost estimation tools provide a lower satisfaction relative to their utilization frequency, while some of the well-established tools appear to be struggling to gain acceptance despite being valued by their practitioners.

Nevertheless, there is an inherent contradiction between the apparent decline of SMA and the sustained growth in the number of concepts, models, tools, theoretical perspectives, disciplines, academic and professional journals and consultancy practices that populate the SM domain.This paradox of SMA is explored in the context of the evolution of the SM literature, SMA practice, as exemplified by two recent case studies, and the cognate literatures of management control, performance measurement and knowledge management. It transpires that the SMA literature is based in large part on a narrow, first-era, view of the SM literature that reached maturity with Michael Porter's industry analysis model and generic competitive strategies.The second era of SM that began in 1977 with a move to a more internal, resource-based view of the firm and competitive advantage has been mostly neglected by the extant SMA literature. However, to judge from the small number of published case studies, SMA practices are developing in line with their strategy formulation and organisational processes. The links among the bundle of techniques that are usually included in SMA and between SMA and cognate literatures need to be integrated into a coherent, cohesive framework to complement SM. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Complementarities; Knowledge management; Management control; New product design and development; Performance measurement; Resource-based view; Strategic management; Strategic management accounting; Strategy-as-practice",,"Ackerman, R.W., How companies respond to social demands (1973) Harvard Business Review, 51 (4), pp. 88-98; Ackoff, R.L., (1970) A Concept of Corporate Planning, , John Wiley and Son, New York; Ahmed, A., Siantonas, G., Siantonas, N., (2008) The 13 Key Performance Indicators for Highly Effective Teams, , Greenleaf Publishing Limited, Sheffield; Anderson, S.W., Managing costs and cost structure throughout the value chain: research on strategic cost management (2007) Handbook of Management Accounting Research, 2, pp. 451-506. , Elsevier, Oxford; Andrews, K.R., (1971) The Concept of Corporate Strategy, , H.

The case study company is a large multinational telecommunication company undergoing a lean transformation process. In this case, lean transformation includes the adoption of agile software development practices. Transformation to agile practices had taken place one year prior to the analysis. The analysis is based on documentation analysis and semi-structured interviews of seven software development professionals. The results show that there were difficulties integrating UX design and software engineering work in an agile and iterative manner. The transition process succeeded in shifting UX and related documentation to a central planning role. The roles of the UX designers in the teams were still under re-definition. There was also a clear need to establish new ways of collaboration between UX professionals and software designers. © 2012 IEEE.","agile; lean transformation; user experience design","agile; Agile practices; Agile software development; Documentation analysis; Lean transformation; Semi structured interviews; Software designers; Telecommunication companies; Transition process; User experience; User experience design; Design; Industry; Software design; Research","Armitage, J., (2004) Are Agile Methods Good for Design?

Clear associations between market, technological, and competitive uncertainties and competitive strategy were not found in either nation. Chinese and Turkish organizations pursuing prospector, defender, and analyzer strategies outperformed their counterparts pursuing the reactor strategy. Scores along Porter's typology suggested marked differences between managers' conceptualization of competitive strategy in both countries. Along the Miles and Snow typology, defenders represented the highest performing group in China, whereas analyzers outperformed other groups in Turkey.

However, with the recent awareness toward a paradigm of sustainable technologies, much of the competitive query is informed by the operational information of users and its localized environmental context. The two have become a pressing insight to build knowledge for providing sustainable solutions. In order to establish a company's competence, once product-oriented companies must now account for uncertain contextual environments and use-based information, and the integration of these factors into technological capabilities and service they provide. The study follows a manufacturing company who has incorporated such knowledge-building processes by advancing their feedback technique, integrating a ""design servicing"" process into their business structure. The process of transforming contextual information into a parameter for their technological services is analyzed here. The paper analyzes how the feedback/information from the operational period of the artifacts were managed a) in the manufacturing and technology sector, and b) as spatial information in the servicing sector of the company. In order to position the boundary of information/technology management within a product-environment relationship, the paper documents technological advancements that are more responsive to environment-driven, contemporary user demands. © 2012 IEEE.",,"After-sales services; Business structures; Contextual environment; Contextual information; Environmental contexts; Feedback techniques; Manufacturing companies; Operational periods; Paper documents; Product assessment; Product manufacturing; Sanitary ware; Spatial informations; Sustainable solution; Sustainable technology; Technological advancement; Technological capability; Technology sectors; User demands; Industrial management; Industry; Manufacture; Sustainable development; Technology; Environmental technology","Alexander, C.W., (1964) Notes on the Synthesis of Form, , Cambridge: Harvard University Press; Baldwin, C.Y., Clark, K.B., (2000) Design Rules: The Power of Modularity, , Cambridge, Mass: The MIT Press; Clark, K.B., Fujimoto, T., (1991) Product Development Performance: Strategy, Organization, and Management in the World Auto Industry, , Boston, Mass: Harvard Business School Press; Courtney, H., Kirkland, J., Viguerie, P., Strategy under uncertainty (1997) Harvard Business Review, 75 (6), pp. 67-79; Fujimoto, T., (1999) The Revolution of A Manufacturing System at Toyota, , New York: Oxford University Press; Fujimoto, T., Framework for monozukuri analysis and architecture analysis (2009) Nihon-gata Purosesu Sangyō: Monozukuri Keieigaku Ni Yoru Kyōsōryoku Bunseki, , T.

First these studies based on questionnaire responses are briefly described. The rest of the paper covers two important areas of investment decision making process. First area concerns investment decision techniques (including profitability measures, payback period, net present value, internal rate of return etc.) used for project appraisal and their implementation rate. The results of own research realized on a sample of 252 companies from the Czech Republic are described. Testing of dependencies using the criteria of investment decisions on selected characteristics of the respondents led to the conclusion that the choice of these criteria affects the size of the undertaking but does not depend on the type of ownership (domestic or foreign). For comparison, the results of other Czech and foreign surveys are described too. Comparison with the results of several foreign researches has demonstrated a significantly higher rate of application of dynamic criteria than in the Czech Republic. Second area compares several ways, in which risk and uncertainty in project appraisal and selection are included. In both of these areas of investment decision making various hypotheses of dependencies of project appraisal and risk analysis techniques on selected parameters of surveyed enterprises are tested. Research has shown a preference for applying verbal risk characteristics, but the frequent use of numerical characteristics was rather surprising. There is no evidence regarding the hypothesis of dependencies of using numerical risk characteristics to company size, strategy formulation, form of ownership etc. Comparison with the results of the foreign research has demonstrated a higher use of sensitivity analysis, scenarios and simulation techniques than in the Czech Republic.","Hypotheses testing; Investment decision making; Investment projects; Project appraisal techniques; Risk analysis; Risk and uncertainty",,"Courtney, H., Kirkland, J., Viguerie, P., Strategy Under Uncertainty (1997) Harvard Business Review, (6), pp. 66-79. , ISSN 0017-8012; Dudek, I., (2003) Riziko a jeho integrace do investiãního rozhodování, , Praha Disertaãní práce (Ph.D.).

Taking a broad view of supply-chain uncertainty (incorporating supply-chain risk), this paper seeks to review the literature in this area and develop a theoretical foundation for future research. The literature review identifies a comprehensive list of 14 sources of uncertainty, including those that have received much research attention, such as the bullwhip effect, and those more recently described, such as parallel interaction. Approaches to managing these sources of uncertainty are classified into: 10 approaches that seek to reduce uncertainty at its source; and, 11 approaches that seek to cope with it, thereby minimising its impact on performance. Manufacturing strategy theory, including the concepts of alignment and contingency, is then used to develop a model of supply-chain uncertainty, which is populated using the literature review to show alignment between uncertainty sources and management strategies. Future research proposed includes more empirical research in order to further investigate: which uncertainties occur in particular industrial contexts; the impact of appropriate sources/management strategy alignment on performance; and the complex interplay between management strategies and multiple sources of uncertainty (positive or negative). © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","alignment theory; contingency theory;

If so, is this effect because such investments help improve sales, or is it because they help reduce overall operating expenses? How does the effect of IT on profitability compare with that of advertising and of research and development? These are important questions because investments in IT constitute a large part of firms' discretionary expenditures, and managers need to understand the likely impacts and mechanisms to justify and realize value from their IT and related resource allocation processes. The empirical evidence in this paper, derived using archival data from 1998 to 2003 for more than 400 global firms, suggests that IT has a positive impact on profitability. Importantly, the effect of IT investments on sales and profitability is higher than that of other discretionary investments, such as advertising and R & D. A significant portion of the impact of IT on firm profitability is accounted for by ITenabled revenue growth, but there is no evidence for the effect of IT on profitability through operating cost reduction. Taken together, these findings suggest that firms have had greater success in achieving higher profitability through IT-enabled revenue growth than through IT-enabled cost reduction. They also provide important implications for managers to make allocations among discretionary expenditures such as IT, advertising, and R & D. With regard to IT expenditures, the results imply that firms should accord higher priority to IT projects that have revenue growth potential over those that focus mainly on cost savings.","Advertising; Cost reduction; Discretionary expenditures; Firm performance; Information technology; Profitability; Profitability paradox; Research and development; Resource-based view; Revenue growth","Discretionary expenditures; Firm Performance; Research and development; Resource-based view; Revenue growth; Commerce; Cost reduction; Economics; Industry; Investments; Management; Managers; Marketing; Profitability; Information technology","Ackermann, M., Vanguard thinks online with new adcampaign (2010) Financial Planning, , http://www.financialplanning.com/news/vanguard-advertising-fidelity- 2666150-1.html, March 15; Andal-Ancion, A., Cartwright, P.A., Yip, G.S., The digital transformation of traditional businesses (2003) MIT Sloan Management Review, 44 (4), pp. 34-41; Anderson, M.C., Banker, R.D., Ravindran, S., The new productivity paradox (2003) Communications of the, 46 (3), pp. 91-94. , ACM; Ansari, A., Mela, C.F., E-customization (2003) Journal of Marketing Research, 40 (2), pp. 131-145. , DOI 10.1509/jmkr.40.2.131.19224; Aral, S., Brynjolfsson, E., Wu, D.J., Which came first, IT or productivity? the virtuous cycle of investment and use in enterprise systems (2006) Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Information Systems, pp. 1819-1840. , Milwaukee, WI; Aral, S., Weill, P., IT assets, organizational capabilities, and firm performance: How resource allocations and organizational differences explain performance variation (2007) Organization Science, 18 (5), pp. 763-780. , 2007; Babakus, E., Bienstock, C.C., Van Scotter, J.R., Linking perceived quality and customer satisfaction to store traffic and revenue growth (2004) Decision Sciences, 35 (4), pp. 713-737; Baker, P., (2005) Proctor Gamble CIO Filippo Passerini on Global Business, , http://authorpambaker.com/upd/Proctor%20& %20Gamble%20Scales%20New%20Heights.pdf, December 22; Banker, R.D., Bardhan, I.R., Asdemir, O., Understanding the impact of collaboration software in product design and development (2006) Information Systems Research (17:4, pp. 352-373; Banker, R.D., Bardhan, I.R., Hsihui, C., Shu, L., Plant information systems, manufacturing capabilities, and plant performance (2006) MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 30 (2), pp. 315-337; Bardhan, I.R., Toward a theory to study the use of collaborative product commerce for product development (2007) Information Technology and Management, 8 (2), pp. 167-184; Bardhan, I.R., Krishnan, V., Lin, S., Project performance and the enabling role of information technology: An exploratory study on the role of alignment (2007) Manufacturing & Service Operations Management, 9 (4), pp. 579-595; Bardhan, I.R., Mithas, S., Lin, S., Performance impacts of strategy, information technology applications, and business process outsourcing in us manufacturing plants (2007) Production and Operations Management, 16 (6), pp. 747-762; Barney, J.B., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage (1991) Journal of Management, 17, pp. 99-120; Barua, A., Kriebel, C.H., Mukhopadhyay, T., Information technologies and business value-an analytic and empirical investigation (1995) Information Systems Research, 6 (1), pp. 3-23; Belsley, D.A., Kuh, E., Welsch, R.E., (1980) Regression Diagnostics: Identifying Influential Data and Sources of Collinearity, , New York: John Wiley & Sons; Bennett, E., (2009) Dell CIO on Culture and Web 2.0, 2009. , http://www.cioinsight.com/c/a/Trends/Culture-Czar-443269/; Bharadwaj, A.S., A resource-based perspective on information technology capability and firm performance: An empirical investigation (2000) MIS Quarterly, 24 (1), pp. 169-196; Bharadwaj, A.S., Bharadwaj, S.G., Konsynski, B.R., Information technology effects on firm performance as measured by tobin's q (1999) Management Science, 45 (7), pp. 1008-1024; Bhatt, G.D., Grover, V., Types of information technology capabilities and their role in competitive advantage: An empirical study (2005) Journal of Management Information Systems, 22 (2), pp. 253-277; Bloch, M., Lempres, E., From internal service provider to strategic partner: An interview with the head of global business services at p & g (2008) The McKinsey Quarterly, pp. 1-9. , July; Bradley, S.P., Bartlett, N., How media choices are changing online advertising (2007) Harvard Business School, , Teaching Note 07- 458; Brynjolfsson, E., Hitt, L., Paradox lost?

Given the high uncertainty inherent in these investments, traditional tools are proven insufficient to identify the true values. On the other hand, real options analysis (ROA) is a powerful valuation tool that put emphasis on the 'real options' of projects. However, most IT managers do not have the necessary skills to carry ROA. In this paper, we give introduction of ROA and propose an easy-to-use framework for using ROA to value investment opportunities. In addition, we discuss common types of real options and describe a case study of deferral option in a real-world investment opportunity. This paper should serve as a good starting point for managers who want to put ROA into practice.

Vision development is a programme management instrument, a programme output, and at the heart of programme learning processes. This article addresses the question what constitutes an appropriate monitoring strategy for vision development activities within system change programmes. Based on action research and literature review on monitoring, evaluation and vision development a monitoring framework is proposed. It is suggested to monitor the programme vision against project visions, societal visions and a set of basic criteria. The monitoring activities themselves are context-sensitive and frequently renegotiated between monitors, programme managers and other stakeholders. The framework is illustrated with a national systems change programme on sustainable agriculture in the Netherlands.","Co-production; Evaluation; Sustainable agriculture; Transition",,"Artto, K., Martinsuo, M., Gemuenden, H.G., Murtoaro, J., Foundations of programme management: A bibliometric view (2009) International Journal of Project Management, 27 (1), pp. 1-18; Borgstein, M.H., Leneman, H., Bos-Gorter, L., Brasser, E.A., Groot, A.M.E., Kerkhof De Van, M.F., (2007) Dialogen over Verduurzaming Van de Nederlandse Landbouw; Ambities en Aanbevelingen Vanuit de Sector., , Wageningen, Wettelijke Onderzoekstaken Natuur and Milieu, WOt-rapport 44; Brunner, R.D., Clark, T.W., A practice-based approach to ecosystem management (1997) Conservation Biology, 11 (1), pp. 48-58; Burton Swanson, E., Ramiller, N.C., The organizing vision in information systems innovation (1997) Organization Science, INFORMS: Institute for Operations Research., 8, pp. 458-474; Courtney, H., Kirkland, J., Vigueri, P., Strategy under uncertainty (1997) Harvard Business Review, 75 (6), pp. 66-79; Davies, R., Scale, complexity and the representation of theories of change (2004) Evaluation, 10 (1), pp. 101-121; Davies, R., Scale, complexity and the representation of theories of change: Part II (2005) Evaluation, 11 (2), pp. 133-149; De Haan, J., Rotmans, J., Patterns in transition: Understanding complex chains of change (2010) Technological Forecast & Social Change, 78, pp. 90-102; De Wolf, P., Hoogland, C.T., (2009) De Sjalon.

Financial decision-making requires one to anticipate how their decision will not only affect their business, but also the economic environment. Unfortunately, all too often, both private and public sector decision-makers view their decisions as one-off responses and fail to see their decisions within the context of an evolving decision-making framework. In Decision-Making in a Dynamic Economic Setting, John Silvia, Chief Economist of Wells Fargo and one of the top 5 economic forecasters according to Bloomberg News and USA Today, skillfully puts this discipline in perspective. Details realistic, decision-making approaches and applications under a broad set of economic scenarios. Analyzes monetary policy and addresses the impact of financial regulations. Examines business cycles and how to identify economic trends, how to deal with uncertainty and manage risk, the building blocks of growth, and strategies for innovation. Decision-Making in a Dynamic Economic Setting details the real-world application of economic principles and financial strategy in making better business decisions. © 2011 John E. Silvia.

In turn, strategy planning and management processes in supply chain are more complicated than a single business. In the process of strategy formulation for a supply chain, it is necessary to consider benefit and abilities of all members. In this chapter, some models for supply chain strategy formulation are discussed, and the most applicable management paradigms of supply chain are investigated. In addition, initiatives, attributes, and appropriate conditions for implementing each paradigm are investigated. Hence, the purpose of this chapter is to give a viewpoint regarding philosophies and concept of supply chain management along with introducing and analyzing some paradigms and practices of supply chain management including lean, agile, leagile, resilient, and green paradigms. © 2012, IGI Global.",,,"Agrawal, A., Shankar, R., Tiwari, M.K., Modeling the metrics of lean, agile and leagile supply chain: An ANP-based approach (2006) European Journal of Operational Research, 173, pp. 211-225. , doi:10.1016/j.ejor.2004.12.005; Alvarez-Gil, M.J., Berrone, P., Husillos, F.J., Lado, N., Reverse logistics, stakeholders' influence, organizational slack, and managers' posture (2007) Journal of Business Research, 60 (5), pp. 463-473. , doi:10.1016/j.jbusres.2006.12.004; Beamon, B.M., Designing the green supply chain (1999) Logistics Information Management, 12 (4), pp. 332-342. , doi:10.1108/09576059910284159; Bellantuono, N., Giannoccaro, I., Pontrandolfo, P., Tang, C.S., The implications of joint adoption of revenue sharing and advance booking discount programs (2009) International Journal of Production Economics, 121, pp. 383-394. , doi:10.1016/j.ijpe.2006.11.023; Bowen, F.E., Cousins, P.D., Lamming, R.C., Faruk, A.C., The role of supply management capabilities in green supply (2001) Production and Operations Management, 10 (2), pp. 174-189. , doi:10.1111/j.1937-5956.2001.tb00077.x; Bowman, R.J., TaylorMade Drives supply-chain efficiency with 24-hour club (2002) Global Logistics & Supply Chain Strategies, pp. 38-43. , October; Bruce, M., Daly, L., Towers, N., Lean or agile: A solution for supply chain management in the textiles and clothing industry?

One way they can respond is by building up strategic flexibility. By looking at airlines' flexibility responses to regulatory uncertainty associated with their inclusion in the European Union Emission Trading Scheme, this article shows that firms can respond to regulatory uncertainty by developing such flexibility in two ways: they can either anticipate the potential consequences of changing regulatory conditions and try to prepare for them; or they can adapt quickly and efficiently to them once the regulatory situation has become clear. By examining evidence from nine case studies, the article identifies the organizational capabilities required to pursue an anticipatory or adaptive strategy and demonstrates that each type of response requires a specific bundle of capabilities. © 2011 by The Regents of the University of California.

Through the structure of different scenarios, we could predict that the new energy in the total energy consumption will reach the proportion of 13.8%, 6.5% and 3% under three different development scenarios by 2020. Then the contextual assessment is carried out and the corresponding policies and measures for the different scenarios are put forward. According to China's Energy Technology Development Roadmap and the actual situation in Hohhot, this paper recommends the optimal situation of the program and the corresponding policies and measures. Practice shows that the contextual analysis for the prediction and policy formulation will have a practical significance. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Contextual analysis; Contextual predic; New energy development","Contextual analysis; Contextual predic; Development scenarios; Energy development; Energy technologies; Policy formulation; Roadmap; Total energy consumption; Electric load forecasting; Energy utilization; Sustainable development; Forecasting","Courtney, H., Kirkland, J., Viguerie, P., Strategy under uncertainty (1997) Harvard Business Review[J], 11-12, pp. 66-79; Dembo, R.S., Freeman, A., (1998) Seeing Tomorrow: Rewriting the Rules of Risk[M], pp. 153-154. , John Wiley & Sons; Chen, X., Li, C., Zheng, Y., Dedicated physical assets under uncertainty Case studies Investment Valuation [J] (2010) Scientific Management Research, (3), pp. 87-91. , in Chinese; Li, C., The evolution of evolutionary economics and technological innovation of new ideas[J] (2006) Inquiry into Economic Issues, (10), pp. 84-88. , in Chinese; Zou, G., Gao, X., Xu, J., Chinese context management and research of theory construction[J] (2009) Soft Science, (2), pp. 135-144. , in Chinese; Zhen, Y., Li, C., The evolutionary analysis theory on Technological innovations[J] (2007) Science and Technology Management Research, (8), pp. 18-22. , in Chinese; Zhen, Y., Li, C., An empirical analysis of the validity of Wagner's law in China-A case study based on Gibbs sampler[J] (2010) International Journal of Business and Management, 5 (6), pp. 161-169. , June; (2009) 2009 China's Sustainable Development Strategy[M], pp. 89-120. , Chinese Academy of Sustainable Development Research Group, Beijing: Science Press, in Chinese; (2009) 2050 China Energy Technology Roadmap[M], pp. 73-82. , Chinese Academy of Energy Strategic Research Group, Beijing: Science Press, in Chinese",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-79961124449

Real options can be an effective tool for managing uncertainty and thereby increasing project value. As most managers do not use real options, but instead intuitively manage uncertainty, understanding the similarities and differences between decision-maker perceptions of real options and real options theory is critical for improving the use of real options for risk management. In the current work, an experiment using a simple uncertain development project and a simulation model capture managers perceptions of real options, including option values. Results show that subjects valued flexibility and conceptually understood option values in ways consistent with theory. Implications for real options research and development are discussed. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","fl exibility; real options; risk management; simulation; uncertainty",,"Alessandri, T.M., Ford, D.N., Lander, D.M., Leggio, K.B., Taylor, M., Managing risk and uncertainty in complex capital projects (2004) Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance, 44 (5 SPEC.ISS.), pp. 751-767. , DOI 10.1016/j.qref.2004.05.010, PII S1062976904000717; Amram, M., The challenge of valuing patents and early-stage technologies (2005) Journal of Applied Corporate Finance, 17 (2), pp. 68-81; Amram, M., Howe, K.M., Capturing the value of fl exibility (2002) Strategic Finance, 84 (6), pp. 10-13; Amram, M., Kulatilaka, N., (1999) Real options: Managing Strategic Investment in an Uncertain World, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard Business School Press; Ashton, R.H., Kramer, S.S., Students as surrogates in behavioral research: Some evidence (1980) Journal of Accounting Research, 18 (1), pp. 1-15; Bailey, W., Couet, B., Lamb, F., Rose, P., Taking a calculated risk (2000) Oilfield Review, 12 (3), pp. 20-35; Baker, H.K., Dutta, S., Saadi, S., Management views on real options in capital budgeting (2011) Journal of Applied Finance, 21 (1), pp. 18-29; Baldwin, C.Y., Clark, K.B., (2000) Design Rules: The Power of Modularity, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Barnett, M.L., Paying attention to real options (2005) R and D Management, 35 (1), pp. 61-72; Benaroch, M., Option-based management of technology investment risk (2001) IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 48 (4), pp. 428-424; Block, S., Are ""real options"" actually used in the real world?

While there has been widespread application of the tools and techniques of project risk management, and good practice has been captured in a large number of different standards and texts, few signs of improvement are apparent in project performance. The article suggest that the inappropriate use of project risk management techniques may be part of the problem rather than part of the solution here, and that we need to rethink project risk management from first principles. Starting from a presumption that project risk management is the essence of project management more generally, the article offers a review of some of the key contributions from psychology and economics that have shaped our thinking before presenting a cognitive model of project risk managing. © Oxford University Press 2011.

Based on a literature review, we categorize responses according to their objective toward regulatory uncertainty into four strategies: avoidance, reduction, adaptation, and disregard strategies. Unique data from a worldwide cross-industry survey show that firms predominantly pursue reduction, and to a lesser extent adaptation and disregard strategies, in response to post-Kyoto regulatory uncertainty. Surprisingly, firms in fact only sporadically pursue avoidance strategies, in contradiction to their own public announcements commonly made during policymaking to realize such strategies. The degree of regulatory uncertainty perceived and its interpretation as a threat increase the pursuit of most of these strategies. In addition, firms' response strategies to post-Kyoto regulatory uncertainty differ across industries and partly across regions. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Climate change; Corporate strategy;

To help managers make informed decisions, this study compiles a comprehensive overview of strategies to cope with regulatory uncertainty and illustrates their interdependencies and how they can be combined into overall coping postures, as well as offering management guidelines on deciding which to adopt. A literature review identifies a considerable variety of coping strategies, and we apply unique data from a worldwide cross-industry survey to categorize each into one of three types - offensive, defensive or passive. We find that firms aiming to cope with the uncertainty associated with post-Kyoto regulation typically adopt one of four strategic postures, each characterized by a specific combination of these types: 'daredevils' rely solely on offensive strategies; 'coordinators' combine them with defensive ones, 'hedgers' pursue strategies from all three categories while 'gamblers' choose not to specifically cope with uncertainty at all. We exemplify the strategies characteristic of each posture, and illustrate their interdependencies by means of case studies in the European airline industry. We identify two main factors managers should consider particularly when deciding on their firm's strategic posture: the level of regulatory uncertainty they perceive and the firm's exposure to future regulations, and find that the higher the level of uncertainty, the broader the range of strategies applied, and the more future regulation seems likely to affect a firm, the more actively it seeks to cope with the associated uncertainty. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Business activities; Coping strategies; Corporate strategies; Cross industry; European airline industry; Government regulation; Informed decision; Literature reviews; Air transportation; Laws and legislation; Management; Managers; Industry; airline industry; coping strategy; corporate strategy; decision making; firm size; governance approach; strategic approach; uncertainty analysis","(2009) Leaders statement - the global plan for recovery and reform, , For the closing communiqué of the meeting, see G-20, Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, London; Rugman, A.M., Verbeke, A., Environmental policy and international business (2001) Oxford handbook of international business, pp. 537-557. , For a recent review of the increasing regulation of international business with particular focus on environmental policy, see, Oxford University Press, New York, A.M.

Wernerfelt and A. Karnani (1987) ibid. Similarly, D. Collis () ibid: 127 refers to this response as 'dedicated,' which 'commits today to one specific strategy and is predicated on a belief that the uncertainty will resolve itself a particular wayLevinthal, D.A., March, J.G., The myopia of learning (1993) Strategic Management Journal, 14 (8), pp. 95-112. , For simplification as a strategy, see; Emery, F.E., The next thirty years: concepts, methods and anticipations (1967) Human Relations, 20 (3), pp. 199-237. , Similarly, suggests a trivialization response that helps firms to cope with uncertainty by limiting the number of uncertain decision criteria and interdependencies amongst them.

However, the effects of an economic downturn on firms' inclination to become more market oriented have not been studied. During the winter 2010, actions of large and middle-size firms in Finland during the recent economic developments were studied, with an aim to find out whether such an inclination exists. The sample consisted of 355 firms. The dominating models of market orientation in the international literature were used as a starting point, somewhat developed to fit the current situation. As a result of the study it can be concluded that, generally speaking, firms did adjust to the economic downturn by attempting to become more market oriented. Some differences could be found in different categories of firms (e.g. manufacturing vs. service firms, btob vs. btoc firms, firms operating on domestic markets only vs. internationally operating firms), but these tendencies were mostly marginal.",,,"Baker, W.E., Sinkula, J.M., Marketing orientation and the new product paradox (2005) The Journal of Product Innovation Management, 22, pp. 483-502; Cano, C.R., Carrillat, F.A., Jaramillo, F., A meta-analysis of the relationship between market orientation and business performance: Evidence from five continents (2004) International Journal of Research in Marketing, 21 (2), pp. 179-200; Chakravarthy, B., A new strategy framework for coping with turbulence (1997) Sloan Management Review, 40 (3), pp. 69-82; Courtney, H., Kirkland, J., Viguerie, P., Strategy under uncertainty (1997) Harvard Business Review, 75 (6), pp. 67-79; Day, G.S., The capabilities of market driven organizations (1994) Journal of Marketing, 58 (4), pp. 37-52; Day, G.S., Continuous learning about markets (1994) California Management Review, 36 (4), pp. 9-31; Degenhardt, T., (2010) Blir Företag Mera Marknadsorienterade i Tider Av Recession?, , Svenska handelshögskolan.

Hazards have been thought to be aberration of the weather systems while there has been an increasingly dominant thought that the hazards are natural part of the weather systems and that the hazards are increasingly becoming disasters due to the human systems coming under their way. While this hypothesis doesn't tell much about how hazards have changed over the years, the thought that one location's hazard profile could change in terms of the intensity and magnitude of hazard or even from one kind of hazard to the other kind is more of recent in nature. This thought has emerged much in line with the increasing consensus on how our climate has been changing over the years. During the early years of the topic of climate change coming into vogue, not many researchers and policy makers heed to it as real. However, climate change today is perceived to be real and the issue is only that whether it is a man-made or natural process. The role of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and national and international media is paramount in raising the awareness and action on climate change. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,,"Adger, W.N., Social vulnerability to climate change and extremes in coastal Vietnam (1999) World Development, 27, pp. 249-269; Adger, W.N., Huq, S., Brown, K., Conway, D., Hulme, M., Adaptation to climate change in the developing world (2003) Progress in Development Studies, 3 (3), pp. 179-195; Alast, M.K., The impacts of climate change on the risk of natural disasters (2006) Disasters, 30 (1), pp. 5-18; Allen, K.M., Community-based disaster preparedness and climate adaptation: Local capacity building in the Philippines (2006) Disasters, 30 (1), pp. 81-101; Alley, R.B., Marotzke, J., Nordhaus, W.D., Overpeck, J.T., Peteet, D.M., Pielke Jr., R.A., Pierrehumbert, R.T., Wallace, J.M., Abrupt climate change (2003) Science, 299 (5615), pp. 2005-2010; Anthes, R.A., Corell, R.W., Holland, G., Hurrell, J.W., Hurricanes and global warming-Potential linkages and consequences (2006) Bulletin of American Meteorological Society, 87, pp. 623-628; (2005) Major Natural Disasters of 2004, , http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0WDP/is_2005_Jan_18/ ai_n8704072, Asian Economic News.

Among the challenges of sustaining the development of this type of airports are the need to synchronize evolving technologies with airports' requirements and investment capabilities, as well as the necessity to identify and characterize the factors that drive the need for technology acquisition. In addition, the difficulty to evaluate risk and make financially viable decisions, particularly when investing in new technologies, should be considered. This work thus proposes a methodology to address these challenges and ensure the sustainability of airport capacity-enhancement investments in a continuously changing environment. More particularly, this work offers to leverage the benefits yielded by impact assessment techniques, system dynamics modeling, and real options analysis to provide small and medium airports with a option-based approach to the valuation and selection of adaptable technology portfolios.","Airport operations;

This research is based on a study of Valtis, a French security transportation firm whose CEO helped to introduce onto the market an innovative system based not on securing goods but on removing temptation: money is no longer carried in armored vehicles but is placed in secure containers, transported by unarmed men traveling in unmarked cars. The article shows that as well as demonstrating technological innovation, this is in fact a radically new business model. It also highlights the double loop learning needed to create it and also the difficulties encountered when two business models (the old and the new one) coexist during and after the strategic experimentation phase. More generally, the article aims to show how the notion of business model opens up the question of strategic regeneration. © 2010 M@n@gement and the author(s).","Business model; Double loop learning; Innovation; Strategic regeneration",,"Affuah, A., Tucci, C., (2001) Internet business models and strategies, , New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; Alt, R., Zimmermann, H.D., Preface: Introduction to special section on business models (2001) Electronic Markets, 11 (1), pp. 3-9; Amit, R., Zott, C., Value creation in e-business (2001) Strategic Management Journal, 22 (6-7), pp. 493-521; Applegate, L.M., E-business models: Making sense of the internet business landscape (2000) Information technology and the future enterprise, new models for managers, pp. 49-101. , G.

The framework classifies risks and uncertainties based on the nature of the risks, levels and sources. Design/methodology/approach – The approach takes the form of conceptual as well as qualitative and quantitative empirical analyses. Findings – Telecommunications operators are faced with various types of risks and uncertainties in their decisionmaking process concerning the upgrade and rollout of their broadband networks. In one respect, these risks and uncertainties have to do with the characteristics of large infrastructural projects, while, on the other hand, being caused by (unknown) competitor behaviour, (unknown) enduser demand, rapid technological development and different development paths available to operators. Framing risks and uncertainties into a typology provides greater insight into the categories, characteristics and sources of the risks and uncertainties, as well as being a first step in finding ways to deal with them. Originality/value – The paper presents and validates a framework for the analysis of risks and uncertainty. It also offers empirical data on how operators manage risk and uncertainties. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Broadband networks; Risk management; Uncertainty management",,"Acimovic-Raspopovic, V., Kostic-Ljubisavljevic, A., Radojicic, V., Dynamic routing design under forecast uncertainty (2003) Proceedings of TELSIKS '03: the 6th International Conference on Telecommunications in Modern Satellite, Cable and Broadcasting Service, 1, pp. 30-33;

This topic has been rarely approached in the literature, which focuses mainly on large and consolidated companies. Spin offs' product development process presents some specificities such as nonlinear and recursive nature, although sequential; straight relation with the business strategy still in formation, affecting it and being affected by it. Based on a review of the pertinent literature and on case studies, we propose a model integrating the spin off 's product development process with the initial business planning process. The Technology Roadmap (TRM) is used to link both processes also aiming at visualizing the business strategy evolution. The final goal is to support researchers/entrepreneurs, incubators, and investors during the initial take-off stage of this kind of enterprise.","Academic spin-offs; Initial planning; Product development process",,"Cheng, L.C., Plano tecnológico: Um processo auxiliar ao desenvolvimento de produtos de empresas de base tecnológica de origem acadêmica (2007) Locus Científco, 1, pp. 32-40; Clark, K.B., Wheelwright, S.C., (1993) Managing New Product and Process Development: Text and Cases, p. 896. , New York: The Free Press; Cooper, R.G., (1993) Winning at New Products: Accelerating the Process From Idea to Launch, , New York: Addison-Wesley Publishing; Cooper, R.G., Edgett, S.J., Kleinschimidt, E.J., Optimizing the stage-gate process: What best practice companies are doing (2002) Research-Technology Management, 45 (5), pp. 21-27; Courtney, H., Kirkland, J., Viguerie, P., Strategy under uncertain (1997) Harvard Business Review, 75 (6), pp. 66-79; (2000) Wharton on Managing Emerging Technologies, , DAY, G.

GPIs are substantial technical advances in the performance of products within technology regimes. Prior studies of innovation timing in the organizational strategy literature emphasize internally driven strategies of GPI. Although internally driven strategies may predominate when businesses face diffuse competition for their product lines, the literature largely overlooks the point that businesses need to be increasingly responsive to external events as market concentration increases. This study, which examines businesses competing in the U.S. packaged software industry in the 1990s, shows that increasing industry concentration raises the stakes surrounding market positions and leads to greater interdependence of innovation strategies in an industry-including interactions both with competitors and with other players in a larger system of complementary products. As concentration increases, therefore, organizations are less driven by historical patterns of innovation and become increasingly responsive to innovations by both types of external actors. © 2010 INFORMS.","Competitive rivalry; Complementary technologies; Generational product innovation; Innovation timing; Time-based pacing",,"Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., (1991) Multiple Regression: Testing and Interpreting Interactions, , Sage Publications, Newbury Park, CA; Amburgey, T.L., Kelly, D., Barnett, W.P., Resetting the clock: The dynamics of organizational change and failure (1993) Admin.

Design/methodology/approach: Longitudinal analysis from 1990 until 2009 has been conducted to evidence factors affecting environmental uncertainty in the European banking industry and how banks have perceived and reacted to it. Findings: The paper evidences banks' strategies in situations of low and medium levels of uncertainty and suggests some behavior to face a high level of crisis. Practical implications: The paper defines a general framework, based on banks' perception and reaction to uncertainty, that can help banks to become champions in facing the current level of uncertainty. Originality/value: The paper presents a critical analysis of how to face the enormous increase of uncertainty that the financial sector is experiencing. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Banking; Europe; Management strategy; Uncertainty management",,"Aguilar, F.J., (1967) Scanning the Business Environment, , Macmillan Publishing, New York, NY; Anderson, C.R., Paine, F.T., Managerial perceptions and strategic behavior (1975) Academy of Management Journal, 18 (4), pp. 811-823; Andrews, K.R., (1971) The Concept of Corporate Strategy, , Dow Jones-Irwin, Homewood, IL; Barr, P.S., Glynn, M.A., Cultural variations in strategic issue interpretation: Relating cultural uncertainty avoidance to controllability in discriminating threat and opportunity (2004) Strategic Management Journal, 25 (1), pp. 59-67; Beard, D.W., The structure of organizational environments: A factor-analytical approach (1978) Organization and Administrative Sciences, 8 (4), pp. 85-105; Boiral, O., The impact of operator involvement in pollution reduction: Case studies in Canadian chemical companies (2005) Business Strategy and the Environment, 14 (6), pp. 339-360; Bourgeois III, L.J., Strategy and environment: A conceptual integration (1980) Academy of Management Review, 5 (1), pp. 25-39; Bourgeois, L.J., Strategic goals, perceived uncertainty, and economic performance in volatile environments (1985) Academy of Management Review, 28 (3), pp. 548-573; Boyd, B.K., Fulk, J., Executive scanning and perceived uncertainty: A multidimensional model (1996) Journal of Management, 22 (1), pp. 1-21; Boyd, B., Dess, G., Rasheed, A., Divergence between archival and perceptual measures of the environment: Causes and consequences (1993) Academy of Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 204-226; Brews, P.J., Hunt, M.R., Learning to plan and planning to learn: Resolving the planning school/learning school debate (1999) Strategic Management Journal, 20 (10), pp. 889-913; Burns, T., Stalker, G., (1961) The Management of Innovation, , Tavistock, London; Carpenter, M.A., Fredrickson, J.W., Top management teams, global strategic posture, and the moderating role of uncertainty (2001) Academy of Management Journal, 44 (3), pp. 533-545; Child, J., Organizational structure, environment and performance: The role of strategic choice (1972) Sociology, 6 (1), pp. 1-22; Child, J., What determines organization performance?

Traditional approaches to system design, acquisition, and risk mitigation are derived from a cost-centric mindset, and as such, they incorporate little information about the value of the spacecraft to its stakeholders. These traditional approaches are appropriate in stable environments. However, the current technical, and economic conditions are distinctly uncertain and rapidly changing. Consequently, these traditional approaches have to be revisited and adapted to the current context. We propose that in uncertain environments, decision-making with respect to design and acquisition choices should be value-based. We develop a value-centric framework, analytical tools, and an illustrative numerical example for communication satellites. Our two proposed metrics for decision-making are the system's expected value and value uncertainty. Expected value is calculated as the expected NPV of the satellite. The cash inflow is calculated as a function of the satellite loading, its transponder pricing, and market demand. The cash outflows are the various costs for owning and operating the satellite. Value uncertainty emerges due to uncertainties in the various cashflow streams, in particular because of market conditions. We propagate market uncertainty through Monte Carlo simulation, and translate it into value uncertainty for the satellite. The end result is a portfolio of Pareto-optimal satellite design alternatives. By using value and value uncertainty as decision metrics in the down-selection process, decision-makers draw more information about the system in its environment, and in making value-based design and acquisition choices, they ultimately make more informed and better choices.

The relevance of this study is related to the importance of the strategy execution in the competitive context, as well as the difficulties faced due to the complexity of the strategic implementation process. Searches were performed into relevant academic journals in order to identify theoretical models that could be useful as a reference to the strategic alignment process. Four models were selected and analyzed based on the content analysis approach. The comparative analysis was deployed into four components: vision of alignment, model for implementation, elements of the model, and managerial procedures for implementation. In each model was identified different vision on how to develop alignment, and which elements and managerial procedures must be considered. The research enhanced the understanding of the factors that contribute to the alignment process effectiveness and how to develop them, besides it identifies gaps in the literature.","Organizational effectiveness; Organizational performance; Organizational strategy (models); Strategic management; Strategic planning",,"Bardin, L., (2000) Análise de conteúdo, 70, p. 225. , Lisboa: Edições; Barney, J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage (1991) Journal of Management, 17 (1), pp. 99-120; Beer, M., Eisenstat, R.A., Developing an organization capable of implementing strategy and learning (1996) Human Relations, 49 (5), pp. 597-603; Beer, M., Eisenstat, R.A., The silent killers of strategy implementation and learning (2000) Sloan Management Review, 41 (4), pp. 29-40. , 12 p., Summer; Bower, J.L., Solving the problems of business planning (1982) Journal of business strategy, 2 (3), pp. 32-44; Campbell, A., Alexander, M., What's wrong with strategy?

Public utility service providers have often been seen as lacking the capacity to identify and/ or implement the needed transformation processes. Instead, privatization has been proposed as a panacea to remedy this deficit. However, privatization projects are often not realized because they encounter strong political opposition. This article presents the results of strategic planning projects in three public wastewater organizations in Switzerland. This study suggests that if appropriate processes are implemented, public utility organizations are able to overcome their limitations in identifying the relevant capability deficits and select adequate strategies to compensate for the deficits. While these strategies may deviate substantially across utilities due to differences in the goals pursued, the widespread adoption of strategic planning methods by public utilities represents a viable alternative to privatization.",,,"(2006) Infrastructure to 2030: Telecom, Land Transport, Water and Eledricity, , OECD, Paris: OECD Publishing;

They can be further specified (or new dimensions can be added) in the course of the process to include issues such as personnel management, asset management, the bureaucratic structures, and both the regulatory and supplier relationships.

To avoid this effect, the facilitators of the process conducted a series of interviews with external stakeholders and analyzed available gray literature on regional developments with a potential impact on the utility. The workshop participants were confronted throughout the process with the information that resulted from this analysis. In addition, insights won from the other case studies were used by the facilitators to recognize and address possible biasesTeece, C., Pisano, and Shuen Zollo and Winter, op. cit",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-65249181567

Traditional approaches to system design, acquisition, and risk mitigation are derived from a cost-centric mindset, and as such they incorporate little information about the value of the spacecraft to its stakeholders. These traditional approaches are appropriate in stable environments. However, the current technical and economic conditions are distinctly uncertain and rapidly changing. Consequently, these traditional approaches have to be revisited and adapted to the current context. We propose that in uncertain environments, decision-making with respect to design and acquisition choices should be value-based. We develop a value-centric framework, analytical tools, and an illustrative numerical example for communication satellites. Our two proposed metrics for decision-making are the system's expected value and value uncertainty. Expected value is calculated as the expected NPV of the satellite. The cash inflow is calculated as a function of the satellite loading, its transponder pricing, and market demand. The cash outflows are the various costs for owning and operating the satellite. Value uncertainty emerges due to uncertainties in the various cash flow streams, in particular because of market conditions. We propagate market uncertainty through Monte Carlo simulation, and translate it into value uncertainty for the satellite. The end result is a portfolio of Pareto-optimal satellite design alternatives. By using value and value uncertainty as decision metrics in the down-selection process, decision-makers draw on more information about the system in its environment, and in making value-based design and acquisition choices, they ultimately make more informed and better choices. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Communication; NPV; Optimization; Pareto; Satellite; System design; Uncertainty; Value","NPV; Pareto; System design; Uncertainty; Value; Commerce; Communication; Computer simulation; Decision making; Design; Economics; Mergers and acquisitions; Monte Carlo methods; Operating costs; Pareto principle; Systems analysis; Communication satellites","Brown, O., Eremenko, P., The value proposition for fractionated space architectures (2006) AIAA Space 2006 Conference and Exposition, , AIAA, San Jose, CA; Saleh, J.H., Flawed metrics: Satellite cost per transponder and cost per day (2008) IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, 44 (1), pp. 147-156; Brathwaite, J., Saleh, J., On the concept of value and its importance to space systems design and acquisition (2008) AIAA Space 2008 Conference and Exposition, , AIAA, San Diego, CA; Saleh, J.H., Torres-Padilla, J.P., Beyond cost models: Communications satellite revenue models-integrating cost considerations into a value-centric mindset (2007) International Journal OfSatellite Communications and Networking, 25 (1), pp. 69-92; Saleh, J.H., Torres-Padilla, J.P., Morgan, E., Sperber, R., Utilization rates of geostationary communication satellites: Models for loading dynamics (2006) Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets, 43 (4), pp. 903-909; Courtney, H., Kirkland, J., Viguerie, P., Strategy under uncertainty (1997) Harvard Business Review, 75 (6), pp. 67-79; Dixit, A.K., Pindick, R.S., (1994) Investment under Uncertainty, , Princeton University Press: Princeton, New Jersey; Lipshitz, R., Strauss, O., Coping with uncertainty: A naturalistic decision-making analysis (1997) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 69 (2), pp. 149-163; Musey, J.A., Stone, J., Takahashi, K., A look inside the Fixed Satellite Services (FSS) industry (2006) White Paper by Near Earth, , http://www.nearearthllc.com/analysis/presentations/FSS%20Industry.pdf, LLC July, cited 20 October 2008; (1999) Space Mission Analysis and Design, , Wertz JR, Larson JL (eds.), (3rd edn), Chapter 20.

Based on a review of the literature on policy formulation, we propose that regulatory uncertainty is characterized by a dependence on political negotiation, a discrete scenario structure, and a discontinuous resolution. Data from a worldwide survey show that firms pursue response strategies to regulatory uncertainty that address these characteristics by participating in policy making and increasing strategic flexibility. Surprisingly, the results also show that regulatory uncertainty only partly causes firms to postpone strategic decisions. We find that existing regulation and a need to act quickly despite regulatory uncertainty are opposed to the pursuit of a postponement strategy. We conclude that improving the mechanisms by which firms participate in early stages of the policy making process could enable them to operate in a more target-oriented manner, allow for more efficient policy implementation, and increase a regulation's effectiveness. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this paper is to propose real option perspective to examine how relational risk perceptions shape commitment behaviour in biotechnology alliance relationships. Design/methodology/approach - The hypotheses are tested with survey data on 344 alliance relationships of European Biotechnology small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Findings - This paper suggests that commitment can be seen as a real option, which reduces the degree of asymmetry of information concerning a partner's behaviour. The findings stress that endogenous uncertainty makes unilateral commitment more attractive, but the conclusion does not show that it enhance perceived relationship effectiveness for the party that unilaterally commits in a unique time period. Research limitations/implications - Nevertheless, within this paper the real options logic to alliance commitments was applied to single dyadic relationships given the alliances were considered an optional context. It would be worthwhile to insert the unilateral commitment decisions for one alliance in the overall portfolio of potential future opportunities. Practical implications - From a managerial point-of-view, this paper shows that unilateral commitments can be seen as the expression of an optional behaviour. These commitments will not benefit the organization in the short term. Managers should adopt a holistic approach and consider all aspects of this problem. Originality/value - This paper tests a model of unilateral commitment and provides empirical evidence to explain some managerial behaviors. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Biotechnology; Europe; Risk management; Small to medium-sized enterprises; Strategic alliances",,"Anderson, E., Weitz, B., ""The use of pledges to build and sustain distribution channels"" (1992) Journal of Marketing Research, 29 (1), pp. 18-34; Andrikopoulos, A., ""The real-options approach to intellectual capital analysis: A critique"" (2005) Knowledge and Process Management, 12 (1), pp. 217-224; Becker, H.S., ""Notes on the concept of commitment"" (1960) American Journal of Sociology, 66 (1), pp. 32-40; Bensaou, M., Anderson, E., ""When do buyers risk making idiosyncratic investments?""

In this paper we describe a robust optimization methodology that explicitly considers randomness in most of the model coefficients while keeping the model computationally tractable. We apply the method to schedule harvest decisions when both timber yield and demand of two products are uncertain. Since uncertain coefficients must be independent, uniform, and symmetrically distributed, we only address uncertainty attributable to estimate errors of forecast models. The methodology was applied to a 245 090 ha forest in British Columbia, Canada. We compared the change in harvest decisions and objective function when robust solutions are implemented relative to deterministic solutions. Although probability bounds can be used to a priori define the probability of constraint violations, they produce conservative solutions. We therefore tested the rates of constraint violations by simulation. While traditional deterministic decisions were always infeasible when uncertain data were simulated, robust decisions were much less sensitive to uncertainty and were, to a large extent, protected against the occurrence of infeasibilities. In exchange, reasonable reductions in the objective function were observed.",,"A-priori; British Columbia , Canada; Constraint violations; Current modeling; Forecast models; Harvest scheduling; Model coefficients; Objective functions; Probability bounds; Real problems; Robust optimizations; Robust solutions; Two products; Uncertain datum; Uncertain environments; Harvesting; Scheduling; Uncertainty analysis; comparative study; decision making; error analysis; optimization; timber harvesting; British Columbia; Canada; North America","British Columbia Ministry of Forests and Range. 2007.

It is found that although most financial managers perceive risk as a project's cash flow volatility, managers that do not use DCF techniques perceive risk asymmetrically as loss. In addition, financial managers are perceptive of company-specific rather than economy-wide uncertainty. It is also found that one in five respondent companies does not use DCF, arguably because of its perceived irrelevance in evaluating short-term projects and its atheoretical demeanor. Overall, these findings confirm that the theory-practice gap still exists in terms of the perception of risk and uncertainty and non-usage of DCF by financial managers of listed companies in the UK. © Kean Ow-Yong, Victor Murinde, 2009.","Discounted cash flow techniques; Risk and uncertainty; UK",,"Alessandri, T.M., (2003) The Impact of Risk and Uncertainty on Rationality: Evidence from Capital Investment Decision Processes, , Working paper presented at the Academy of Mangement Conference, Seattle, WA; Alessandri, T.M., Ford, D.N., Lander, D.M., Leggio, K.B., Taylor, M., Managing risk and uncertainty in complex capital projects (2004) Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance, 44 (5 SPEC.

Design/methodology/approach General conclusions are drawn and strategic implications derived from a survey of 355 UK manufacturing companies which had expressed interest in the introduction of new computer-based technology. Findings It was found that the companies with strategy-technology integration showed better financial and operational performance. Strategies of technology leadership and market orientation were also associated with enhanced financial performance. However, a number of organisational conditions were found to be necessary for the pursuit of these strategies. Research limitations/implications Further research is needed to examine the process and structure in which strategy technology can be better integrated. Practical implications Firms should strive to achieve strategy-technology integration to maximise the benefits of adopting new technologies.

Globalization, liberalization, information revolution and ICT phenomena have brought about many challenges for all organizations more seriously for SMEs. The only way to cope with these impediments is to be strategically flexible and adaptable to environmental changes and emergent circumstances. Strategic Flexibility requires a comprehensive set of abilities to acquire, interpret, share and utilize knowledge by scanning internal and external environments carefully and profoundly in order to take immediate and proper actions. Therefore managing knowledge is an inseparable component of strategic flexibility. An integrated system has to be executed to strategize all enterprise activities based on knowledge toward becoming flexible strategically. But in enterprise's management literature a dearth of an intensive study in the context of SMEs is vividly felt. Therefore, addressing this gap seems worthwhile for SME's competitiveness; hence, the main objective of this study is to fill the gap empirically based on case-study of some service provider and manufacturing SMEs in Malaysia.

In this paper, however, we argued that there is lot to do before we get our hands on reliable estimates of future climate change impacts. It includes bringing together different stakeholders in a framework suggested in this paper, developing case studies that reflect long-term local impacts of climate change, capacity building of local stakeholders that enables them to take decisions under uncertainty etc. We proposed a simple scheme that brings together climate, disaster and policy community together to start a dialogue in a run-up to understanding wider aspects of long-term risk reduction at local level. Strategic thinking, which has only been restricted to national and regional planning to date, needs to be inculcated in local level disaster risk reduction and policy personnel as well. There is a need to move from the attitude of considering local level players as 'implementers' to 'innovators' for which developing a network of self learning and evolving organizations are required at the local level. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Climate change; Climate task group; Local disaster risk reduction planning; Strategic planning; Uncertainty","climate change; climate effect; disaster management; local planning; regional planning; risk assessment; stakeholder; strategic approach; uncertainty analysis","Adger, W.N., Social vulnerability to climate change and extremes in coastal Vietnam (1999) World Dev, 27, pp. 249-269; Adger, W.N., Huq, S., Brown, K., Conway, D., Hulme, M., Adaptation to climate change in the developing world (2003) Prog Dev Stud, 3, pp. 179-195. , 3; Adger, W.N., Arnell, N.W., Tompkins, E.L., Successful adaptation to climate change across scales (2005) Glob Environ Change, 17, pp. 77-86; Alast, M.K., The impacts of climate change on the risk of natural disasters (2006) Disasters, 30, pp. 5-18. , 1; Alexander, D., The study of natural disasters, 1977-1997: Some reflections on a changing field of knowledge (1997) Disasters, 21, pp. 284-304. , 4; Allen, K.M., Community-based disaster preparedness and climate adaptation: Local capacity building in the Philippines (2006) Disasters, 30, pp. 81-101. , 1; Allen, M.R., Ingram, W.J., Constraints on future changes in climate and hydrological cycle (2002) Nature, 419, pp. 224-232; Alley, R.B., Marotzke, J., Nordhaus, W.D., Overpeck, J.T., Peteet, D.M., Pielke Jr., R.A., Pierrehumbert, R.T., Wallace, J.M., Abrupt climate change (2003) Science, 299, pp. 2005-2010. , 5615; Anthes, R.A., Corell, R.W., Holland, G., Hurrell, J.W., Hurricanes and global warming-potential linkages and consequences (2006) Bull Am Meteorol Soc, 87, pp. 623-628; Major natural disasters of 2004 (2005) Asian Economic News, , http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0WDP/is_2005_Jan_18/ ai_n8704072, Asian Economic News January 18, 2005.

Dealing with the results of demographic, economic and physical contraction processes and planning for the future of considerably smaller but nevertheless livable cities presents some of the most challenging tasks for urban Europe in the near future. This article highlights the example of Dresden in Eastern Germany, where the breakdown of the state-directed economy caused economic decline, industrial regression, and high unemployment rates. Due to out migration and decreasing birth rates, the city lost 60,000 of its 500,000 residents within one decade. As a consequence, there were housing and office vacancies as well as infrastructure oversupplies. Yet the administrative system was still directed towards growth objectives throughout the 1990s. Only after 2000 this situation changed dramatically. The new strategic plan for Dresden is no longer growth oriented. Instead, it focuses on a model of the compact 'European city', with an attractive urban centre, reduced land consumption, and a stable population. However, in another unexpected turn of events, within the last seven years the city has experienced an unexpected growth of 25,000 residents. Surprisingly, processes of suburbanization have turned into processes of reurbanization. Today in Dresden, areas of shrinkage and decline are in close proximity to prospering and wealthy communities. The strategic challenge is to deal with this patchwork while accepting that the future remains unpredictable. Hence, strategic flexibility becomes more important than the strategy itself. To a certain extent rational analysis and error prevention is displaced by preparedness, robustness, and resilience as key qualifications of planning in shrinking cities.",,"economic growth; planning process; population decline; strategic approach; urban area; urban economy; urban planning; urban population; Central Europe; Dresden; Eurasia; Europe; Germany; Saxony","Allweil, Y., Shrinking cities: Like a slow-motion Katrina (2007) Places, 19 (1), pp. 91-93; Amin, A., Thrift, N., (1994) Globalization, Institutions and Regional Development in Europe, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Beauregard, R.A., (2003) Voices of Decline, The Postwar Fate of US Cities, , Routledge, London/New York; Wegweiser Demographischer Wandel 2020 (2006) Analysen Und Handlungskonzepte Fur Stadte Und Gemeinden, , Stiftung Bertelsmann Bertelsmann Stiftung, Gutersloh; Bontje, M., Facing the challenge of shrinking cities in East Germany: The case of Leipzig (2004) Geojournal, 61, Pp. 13-21., pp. 13-21; Booth, D., Regional long waves and urban policy (1987) Urban Studies, 24, pp. 447-459; Boren, T., Gentile, M., Metropolitan processes in post-communist states: An introduction (2007) Geografiska Annaler Series B: Human Geography, Journal Compilation, Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography, 89 (2), pp. 95-110; Bourne, L., Simmons, J., New fault lines?

It separates the strategic choices and directions used for idea generation, during start-up, and beyond business or brand establishment. Corroborating much of the literature, it argues that traditional notions of strategy might be inappropriate for some dotcom firms due to the high level of complexity, speed of change and competitiveness characteristic of the Internet environment. As has been observed by research, idea generation on the Internet can involve prospecting and reacting quickly to markets to a greater extent than amongst traditional businesses. Likewise, start-up strategies often appear to involve flexibility and an openness to strategic change in response to the fast dynamic nature of the online market. The chapter suggests alternative strategy models that might be useful in our understanding of Internet business creation and development. © 2008, IGI Global.",,,"Afuha, A., Tucci, C.L., (2001) Internet Business Models and Strategies, Text, and Cases, , New York, McGraw-Hill; Alvesson, M., Willmott, H., (1996) Making Sense of Management: A Critical Approach, , London, Sage Publications; Amit, R., Zott, C., Value creation in e-business (2001) Strategic Management Journal, 22 (6-7), pp. 493-520; Anelli, M., (2005) What is Chaos Theory?, , http://www.ufdbparam.info/spip/article.php3?id_article=2, Ufdbparam (online) Retrieved August 6, 2005, from; Aram, J.D., Cowan, S.S., Strategic planning for increased profit in the small business (1990) Long Range Planning, 23 (6), pp. 63-70; Beaver, G., Ross, E.C., Enterprise in recession: The role and context of strategy (2000) International Journal of Entrepreneurship and Innovation, 1 (1), pp. 23-31; Beaver, G., Prince, C., Management, strategy, and policy in the uk small business sector: A critical review (2004) Journal of Small Business and Enterprise Development, 11 (1), pp. 34-49; Berry, M., Strategic planning in small high tech companies (1998) Long Range Planning, 31 (3), pp. 455-466; Bouchikhi, H., A constructive framework for understanding entrepreneurship performance (1993) Organisational Studies, 14 (4), pp. 549-570; Brown, S., Blackmon, K., Aligning manufacturing strategy and business-level competitive strategy in new competitive environments: The case for strategic resonance (2005) Journal of Management Studies, 42 (4), pp. 793-815; Carrier, C., Raymond, L., Eltaief, A., Cyberentrepreneurship: A multiple case study (2004) International Journal of Entrepreneurial Behaviour and Research, 10 (5), pp. 349-363; Cassia, L., Fattore, M., Paleari, S., (2006) Entrepreneurial Strategy, , Cheltenham: Edward Elgar; Chen, S., Strategic decision-making by ecommerce entrepreneurs (2003) International Journal of Management and Decision Making, 4 (2-3), pp. 133-142; Chen, S., (2005) Strategic Management of E-business, , (2nd ed.).

The article provides a strong justification for the use of both models, when used independently, but particularly in conjunction, as powerful strategic analytical frameworks that can significantly encourage and illuminate strategic discourses in public sector organizations. The article establishes that strategic tools such as value chain analysis, when applied in the public sector context, require significant adaptation to maximize their contribution to understanding a given situation. This study proposes that the strategic analysis of relationships that build or contribute to concepts of organizational value are of limited importance if the complex web of interdependent relationships themselves are not clearly demonstrated. This work therefore makes a clear case for applying two strategic models, value chain analysis and stakeholder analysis, in an analogous way to demonstrate how strategic understanding in the public sector is enhanced as a result of such symbiosis.","New public management; Stakeholder mapping; Strategic management; Strategic tools; Value chain analysis",,"Amaratunga, D., Baldry, D., Sarshar, M., Process Improvement through Performance Measurement: The Balanced Scorecard Methodology (2001) Work Study, 50 (5), pp. 179-188; Ambrosini, V., (1998) Exploring Techniques of Analysis and Evaluation in Strategic Management, , Prentice Hall Europe, Hemel Hempstead; Andrews, P.P., Hahn, J., Transforming Supply Chains into Value Webs (1998) Strategy & Leadership, 26 (3), pp. 7-11; Barley, S.R., Freeman, J., Hybels, R., Strategic Alliances in Commercial Biotechnology (1992) Networks and Organisations, , Harvard Business School Press, Harvard; Beinhocker, E., Strategy at the Edge of Chaos (1997) McKinsey Quarterly, 1, pp. 22-40; Boyne, G.A., Public and Private Management: What's the Difference?

It focuses on the crystallization role that communities of practice can play and on how they can provide a space in which new technological options can gain credibility. It draws on in-depth analysis of one case study - the emergence of asynchronous logic - an alternative architecture to the prevalent clock-based logic. It shows that although the communities of practice studied recognized the value of asynchronous logic, it was unable to change the wider institutional environment, linked in this case with the establishment of one standard which would enable the microelectronics industry to adopt this technology. In light of this, the chapter concludes that inter-organizational expert communities of practice should be seen as enablers of multiple explorations in the life cycle of breakthrough innovations rather than as facilitators of exploitation. © Oxford University Press 2008.

This necessitates an organizing framework that smoothly integrates and places different conceptualizations of strategy in the proper perspective. The purpose of this paper is to clear possible confusion about the concept of strategy and help navigate the different streams of the strategy river with confidence and ease. Design/methodology/approach - A comprehensive review of strategy literature is undertaken and the underlying principles and governing ideas are extracted. These are reconstructed to form the basis of the ""strategy frame"". Findings - The ""strategy frame"" produced the four Es of strategy, which represent the strategic thinking drivers behind the different conceptualizations of strategy. The framework attempts to address all major strategy issues and to combine different schools of thought spanning the spectrum of strategy dimensions, tensions, and paradoxes. It interweaves competing schools of thought in the strategy field and conceptualizes them as continuums to illustrate their interplay. Research limitations/implications - The conceptual nature ofthe ""strategy frame"" makes it less useful in answering the questions it helps raise. As such, it is so broad to be used for working out detailed strategies. Practical implications - The ""strategy frame"" helps strategists take a bird's eye view to identify critical strategic issues and put them in the proper context of their organization's capacity as it relates to its environment. Originality/value - The paper attempts to deal with the basic tensions and paradoxes in strategy field in order to develop a hopefully useful framework, which is able to relate them in an integrative way.","Competitive advantage; Management strategy; Strategic management; Uncertainty management",,"Abell, D.F., ""Competing today while preparing for tomorrow"" (1999) Sloan Management Review, 40 (3), pp. 73-81; Anthony, S.D., Eyring, M., Gibson, L., ""Mapping your innovation strategy"" (2006) Harvard Business Review, 84 (5), pp. 104-113; Argyres, N., McGahan, A.M., ""An interview with Michael Porter"" (2002) Academy of Management Executive, 16 (2), pp. 43-52; Baden-Fuller, C., Volberda, H.W., ""Strategic renewal: How large complex organizations prepare for the future"" (1997) International Studies of Management and Organization, 27 (2), pp. 95-120; Beaver, G., ""The language of strategy"" (2000) Strategic Change, 9, pp. 465-468; Beinhocker, E.D., ""Robust adaptive strategies"" (1999) Sloan Management Review, 40 (3), pp. 95-106; Bowman, C., Ambrosini, V., ""Value creation versus value capture: Towards a coherent definition of value in strategy"" (2000) British Journal of Management, 11 (1), pp. 1-14; Brews, P.J., ""Star trek strategy: Real strategy at work"" (2003) Business Strategy Review, 14 (3), pp. 34-43; Burgelman, R.A., Doz, Y.L., ""The power of strategic integration"" (2001) MIT Sloan Management Review, 42 (3), pp. 28-38; Chakravarthy, B., ""A new strategy framework for coping with turbulence"" (1997) Sloan Management Review, 38 (2), pp. 69-82; Chakravarthy, B.S., Lorange, P., ""Adapting strategic planning to the changing needs of a business"" (1991) Journal of Organizational Change Management, 4 (2), pp. 6-18; Christensen, C., ""The past and future of competitive advantage"" (2001) MIT Sloan Management Review, 42 (2), pp. 105-109; Christensen, C.M., Johnson, M.W., Rigby, D.K., ""Foundations for growth: How to identify and build disruptive new businesses"" (2002) MIT Sloan Management Review, 43, pp. 22-31; Clark, T., ""Strategy viewed from a management fashion perspective"" (2004) European Management Review, 1, pp. 105-111; Cohin, M.A., Agrawal, N., Agrawal, V., ""Winning in the aftermarket"" (2006) Harvard Business Review, 84 (5), pp. 129-138; Collis, D., ""Organizational capability as a source of profit"" (1996) Organizational Learning and Competitive Advantage, pp. 139-163. , in Moingeon, B. and Edmondson, A.

Based on an in-depth case analysis of the penetration of asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) in Korea, the present study explores the patterns of decision making and interactions among key innovation actors, such as the government, Internet service providers, equipment providers, and content providers, using a conceptual framework wherein models of innovation systems and decision making under uncertainty are combined. The results revealed that the Korean government played a pivotal role in the creation of the ADSL-based Internet service market by providing a strong vision for this emerging service, building a coalition among various key actors, and stimulating initial market needs and supply of necessary equipment during the early period of higher uncertainty. As the level of uncertainty decreased with market evolution, however, the role of industrial actors and their market competition became more important to the rapid growth of the ADSL market. Based on these findings, policy and managerial implications are proposed. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach – Review of the literature and reflection on the practice of being actively involved in conducting and supervising academic research and disseminating academic output. The paper argues the case for the potential usefulness of reflective academic research to PM practitioners. It also highlights theoretical drivers of and barriers to reflective academic research by PM practitioners. Findings – A reflective learning approach to research can drive practical results though it requires a great deal of commitment and support by both academic and industry partners. Practical implications – This paper suggests how PM practitioners can engage in academic research that has practical outcomes and how to be more effective at disseminating these research outcomes. Originality/value – Advanced academic degrees, in particular those completed by PM practitioners, can validate a valuable source of innovative ideas and approaches that should be more quickly absorbed into the PM profession’s sources of knowledge.

The main challenges in using the method are related to avoiding subjective bias, identifying the most relevant trends, uncertainties and stakeholders and building consistent and coherent scenarios. The method is a systematic way to assess possible future outcomes, but does not provide a detailed understanding of them. Scenario planning serves as a structure for brainstorming sessions, and as a basis for a more detailed analysis using quantitative methods. We applied Schoemaker’s scenario planning to the emerging mobile Peer-to-Peer Session Initiation Protocol (P2PSIP) communications services. According to our analysis, a potential P2PSIP stakeholder should seek settings where network and legal aspects are the most favourable: ad hoc and private environments without interconnectivity to the internet. A stakeholder considering global service provisioning should evaluate the semi-centralised public global scenario. © 2008 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","decision making; emerging service; mobile; P2PSIP; peer-to-peer session initiation protocol; scenario planning; telecommunications",,"Adrian, J.E., VoIP on tap: whether the FCC should apply wiretapping standards to voice over internet protocol (2005) Administrative Law Review, 57, pp. 647-668; Ahn, J.-H., Skudlark, A., Managing risk in a new telecommunications service development process through a scenario planning approach (2002) Journal of Information Technology, 17, pp. 103-118; Amit, R., Zott, C., Value creation in e-business (2001) Strategic Management Journal, 22, pp. 493-520; Baset, S., Schulzrinne, H., Matuszewski, M., Peer-to-peer protocol (P2PP) (2007) IETF Draft-Baset-p2psip-p2pp-01, , http://www3.tools.ietf.org/html/draft-baset-p2psip; Bradfield, R., Wright, G., Burt, G., Cairns, G., Van Der Heijden, K., The origins and evolution of scenario techniques in long range business planning (2005) Futures, 37, pp. 795-812; Bria, A., Gessler, F., Queseth, O., Stridh, R., Unbehaun, M., Wu, J., Zander, J., Flament, M., 4th-generation wireless infrastructures: scenarios and research challenges (2001) IEEE Personal Communications, 8, pp. 25-31; Bryan, D., Matthews, P., Shim, E., Willis, D., Concepts and terminology for peer to peer SIP (2007) IETF Draft-ietf-p2psip-Concepts-01, , http://www3.tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-p2psip-concepts-01; Chen, Y.-K., Lin, Y.-B., IP connectivity for gateway GPRS support node (2005) IEEE Wireless Communications, 12, pp. 37-46; Courtney, H., Kirkland, J., Viguerie, P., Strategy under uncertainty (1997) Harvard Business Review, 75, pp. 66-79; Godet, M., From forecasting to ‘la prospective’: a new way of looking at futures (1982) Journal of Forecasting, 1, pp. 293-301; Godet, M., The art of scenarios and strategic planning: tools and pitfalls (2000) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 65, pp. 3-22; Godet, M., Roubelat, F., Creating the future: the use and misuse of scenarios (1996) Long Range Planning, 29, pp. 164-171; Gray, P., Hovav, A., Using scenarios to understand the frontiers of IS (1999) Information Systems Frontiers, 1, pp. 15-24; Haßlinger, G., ISP platforms under a heavy peer-to-peer workload (2005) P2P Systems and Applications (pp.369–381), , R.

The Institute of Medicine's (IOM) latest monograph [31] is titled Rewarding Provider Performance, and it will be published this year. The report makes specific recommendations regarding changes to the health care delivery system. Although the report is not explicit in terms of its implications for anesthesiology, it broadly involves all providers. The report calls for the systematic and deliberate use of payment incentives. Pay-for-performance programs (P4P) are used effectively in many countries, with the greatest use in the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. United States use is currently at 30%, one of the smaller percentages of involvement in the developed world. The report calls for widespread use of an electronic medical record (EMR), which should include an anesthesia EMR, public reporting of outcomes, and incentives for beneficiaries. The IOM advisory group made 10 recommendations, many of which affect anesthesia providers. One of these recommendations was to establish a series of demonstration projects to determine the effectiveness of P4P programs. A number of these are already underway, The IOM discussed funding sources for performance incentives from the existing funds. Much of the report discussed combining funding sources across institutional silos to incentivize collaborative behaviors (ie, combining Medicare parts A and B). This would drive interdisciplinary collaboration and information sharing to produce higher-quality, patient-centered, and cost-efficient care. The report additionally calls for monitoring of outcomes focused on quality, cost, and customer service. The incentives initially will reward both high and most improved performers, but eventually will reward only high performers. The report outlines incentives for submission of physician data effective this year, which will become mandatory for all providers by 2010. They propose rewarding the coordination/coordinator of care. They support the national campaign to incentivize office-based use of the EMR until 2013 when the providers will have to bear the cost of EMR maintenance. As Porter and Teisberg [1] discuss in their book, Redefining Health Care, the premise is that excellence in patient care will lead to greater access to care, greater efficiency, and higher margins. The financial viability of an institution cannot be the goal of the system redesign, but it will be an outcome. They identify eight imperatives for all providers:•Redefine the business around medical conditions.•Choose a range in the type of services that provided.•Organize around medically integrative practice units.•Create a distinct strategy for each unit.•Measure results, experience methods, and patient attributes by the unit.•Move to single, consolidated bills, and new approaches to pricing and pricing transparency.•Market service based on excellence, uniqueness, and results.•Grow locally and geographically in areas of strength. Some of these will be challenges for anesthesia providers in that their practices are defined in terms of a specific service or a specialty rather than a medical condition. This view, however, is more doctor-centric than patient-centric. What has become evident to both payers and providers is that the real value depends on the performance of many people. A perfect example of this occurs daily in the operating room, where many participate in achieving the best outcome, including the surgeon, anesthesiologist, nurse, radiologist, and skilled technician, among others. The real value depends on everyone performing well. The entire care cycle will now be the focus and only will be as strong as the weakest component. This will not eliminate the need for large specialty-specific provider groups, but it will change how anesthesiologists operate. The constituent hospitals, clinics, and physician practices operate largely in their own silos.""In a value-based health care system, (these) provider groups will retain a role only if they can demonstrate excellent results...and medically integrate services across the entities in the group. Rather than duplicating care and relying on bargaining power, care delivery must be radically restructured, or groups will lose market share once they have to compete on value"" [1]. All providers face important strategic decisions on how to structurally align themselves with a health plan into a vertically integrated organization. Kaiser Permanente has been a commonly cited example. Other vertically integrated groups include Sentera Health care and Intermountain Health care. Vertical integration mitigates the adversarial relationship between a health plan and provider and allows the incentives to be better aligned. There are problems with the vertically integrated model, however. As Porter and Teisberg [1] point out, combining a health plan with the provider network eliminates or suppresses the competition at the provider level, where it matters most. Combining insurance and provision of services essentially creates a system of global capitation, which ""creates a strong incentive to reduce costs via limiting services, because the health care system receives a fixed amount per provider."" Success comes more from a process by which physicians and hospitals interact with each other than from any fixed employment or partnership model. Success is determined less by a model of care than by the execution of process that goes with it [32]. It seems that every decade brings a new model or structure promising to deliver quality, efficient care across the spectrum of providers. It was a promise of managed care; it was the promise of integrated networks, and today many argue that it is the model of consumer-driven choice and outcomes-based P4P. No matter what model ultimately prevails, however, the relationships with physicians are central to success. Physicians have many choices. They can choose to go into small private practice, large group practice, work under the umbrella of an organization like Kaiser, join an academic practice model, or be hospital employees. They can be competitors or part of the team. There are some trends pushing physicians toward employment models, including increasing costs and complexity of private practice and lifestyle considerations. There always are going to be a broad mix of physicians, however, and some subset of these will want to be in private practice. Hospitals will need to continue to have multiple ways of working with physicians, if for no other reason than physicians are perhaps by nature contradictory people. There are fewer are hassles and less paper work in multispecialty groups, but surveys show that control and autonomy are still of paramount importance to physicians. This requires a certain amount of flexibility from hospitals. More importantly, hospital systems will need to treat physicians as partners in a continuum of care. Giving them a meaningful role in decision making, building trust, and emphasizing good communication are all critical aspects. Fixed salary, regular hours, and administrative relief are important and attractive components, but the most successful models go further than that. They build strong relationships with physicians by equipping them with the infrastructure to be better at what they really want to do, practice medicine. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

We test the propensity to co-locate with dominant firms and whether proximity to a dominant firm impacts the strategic choices made by start-ups and established firms. Contrary to our predictions, we find that both start-ups and established firms are equally likely to co-locate with dominant firms. We also find that start-ups exhibit greater new product adoption rates and greater product-line breadth than established firms. This implies that start-ups are relatively more likely to realize greater strategic gains with entry into emerging markets.","Dominant and startup firms; Emerging technology; Innovations; Strategic location choice","fiber optics;

If you have been looking for the one resource for managing a business of any size, this is it. Based on the extensive business experience of five experts, this authoritative guide provides an in-depth look at what every leader must know about managing across departments, functions, divisions, or companies. Drawing on decades of combined experience, John Colley and colleagues detail the wide range of skills, tools, and conceptual understanding as well as the qualities of leadership that a successful general manager must acquire. In an era of specialization and specialists, the authors return due focus to the generalist. No other book so passionately and thoroughly examines the roles and responsibilities of the general manager and the full scope of this distinct, pressure-filled occupation. The authors explore the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the job and discuss how the skilled manager moves an organization from abstract goals to definitive action. For every profit center or plant manager, function head, division president, or CEO, this book is indispensable reading. © 2007 by Yale University.

Information (or its absence) is central to decision making situations involving uncertainty and complexity, while knowledge (or its absence) is associated with problems of ambiguity and equivocality. This paper proposes that computer-based decision support technologies are appropriate to supporting decision making under conditions of uncertainty and complexity, while human-centric approaches may be more appropriate under conditions of ambiguity or equivocality. Both approaches, however, must be tightly integrated for organizational learning to occur.

Design/methodology/approach - The study adopts grounded theory research method using interview as the primary data source. 100 NPD management issues, sourced from 16 senior managers from six technology-based organizations in Malaysia, were investigated and analyzed. Findings - The study revealed four categories of NPD management issues; strategic NPD management issues, NPD project management issues, NPD process and structural issues, and NPD people management issues. The study also found that senior managers apply different patterns of decision-making approaches in dealing with each category of NPD management issues. Research limitations/implications - Although the findings from this study are within the specific context of technology-based organizations in Malaysia, this exploratory study opens up a number of questions for further investigation. Practical implications - The discussion from this paper should also stimulate senior managers from other organizations or from other locations to reexamine categories of management issues in their organizations and how they approach them from a decision-making perspective. This reflection could help identify areas which need further decision-making skills development. Originality/value - The classification of NPD management issues provides description of NPD management issues and the corresponding common decision-making approaches. The study which was carried out at technology-based organizations in Malaysia contributed to narrow down the geographical imbalances of NPD literatures, contributed to the body of NPD management literatures by bridging it with decision-making theoretical perspective, and contributed to the naturalistic decision research stream.","Decision making; Malaysia; New product development",,"Ali, A., Kalwani, M.U., Kovenock, D., ""Selecting product development projects: Pioneering versus incremental innovation strategies"" (1993) Management Science, 39 (3), pp. 255-274; Baker, M.J., ""Research Methods"" (2002) The Marketing Review, 3 (2), pp. 167-193; Balachandra, R., Friar, J.H., ""Factors for success in R&D projects and new product innovation: A contextual framework"" (1997) IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 44 (3), pp. 276-287; Beach, L., Chi, M., Klein, G., Smith, P., Vicente, K., ""Naturalistic decision making and related research lines"" (1997) Naturalistic Decision Making, , in Zsambok, C. and Klein, G.

This approach, however, is often not feasible with rare diseases such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Methods: We review the principles of evidence-based medicine to see which are particularly pertinent to the study of rare diseases. Results: When an RCT is not feasible, attention is given to determining all the available prior data. Evaluation of the new data and the historic base requires attention to biases, but can allow estimation of a ""true"" study result.

I identify two problems hindering efforts to answer this question: past studies have generally theorized about a different dependent variable than they have measured, and they have conflated the concepts of uncertainty, ambiguity, and instability in accounting for environmental moderation. I then reframe the question and propose ways of characterizing organizational information environments so researchers can identify more precisely those real-world contexts across which the value of comprehensiveness varies.

Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, University of South Florida, Department of Interdisciplinary Oncology, 12902 Magnolia Drive, Tampa, FL 33612, United States","This paper introduces taxonomy of clinical uncertaintes and argues that the choice of scientific method should match the underlying level of uncertainty. Clinical trial is one of these methods aiming to resolve clinical uncertainties. Whenever possible these uncertainties should be quantified. The paper further shows that the still ongoing debate about the usage of ""equipoise"" vs. ""uncertainty principle"" vs. ""indifference"" as an entry criterion to clinical trials actually refers to the question ""whose uncertainty counts"". This question is intimately linked to the control of research agenda, which is not quantifiable and hence is not solvable to equal acceptability to all interested parties. The author finally shows that there is a predictable relation between [acknowledgement of] uncertainty (the moral principle) on which trials are based and the ultimate outcomes of clinical trials. That is, [acknowledgement of] uncertainty determines a pattern of success in medicine and drives clinical discoveries.

In order to estimate the key performance indices of these Supply Chains and to facilitate their management, it is necessary to use more elaborate tools such as a simulation. However building simulation of customer-centric supply chains is no trivial matter. It requires the elaboration of a representative model and the execution of this model according to a set of hypotheses associated to scenarios. Due to their properties, Multi-Agent Systems seem particularly well suited for the modelling and the simulation of Supply Chains and more especially in a mass customization context. In this paper we propose an agent modelling framework for the modelling and simulation of such Supply Chains to facilitate their management. We show how this framework can be applied to a case of customer-centric Supply Chain from the golf club industry and we present an experiment plan associated. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This study aims to examine the viability of strategic postures of technological differentiation in such a setting using data from 1,054 samples across 32 industries in 30 countries during 2001-2002, when global economies suffered a downturn. The empirical results show that differentiation-oriented firms under-performed efficiency-oriented ones during this period. However, in the face of deteriorating market conditions, a strategic orientation toward technological differentiation, in concert with an internal commitment to R&D investment or external munificence toward technological opportunity, yields better performance. Finally, this study finds that firms with tight coupling between differentiation and efficiency outmaneuver those with a pure strategy or no strategy at the time of an economic downturn. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,,"Abernathy, W.J., Utterback, J.M., Patterns of industrial innovation (1978) Technology Review, 80 (7), pp. 41-47; Agrell, P.J., Wikner, J., A coherent methodology for productivity analysis employing integrated partial efficiency (1996) International Journal of Production Economics, 46-47 (3), pp. 401-411; Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., (1993) Multiple Regression: Testing and Interpreting Interactions, , London: Sage; Audretsch, D.B., Feldman, M.P., R&D spillovers and the geography of innovation and production (1996) American Economic Review, 86 (3), pp. 630-640; Aulakh, P.S., Kotabe, M., Teegen, H., Export strategies and performance of firms from emerging economies: Evidence from Brazil, Chile, and Mexico (2000) Academy of Management Journal, 43 (3), pp. 342-361; Bailey, G., Szerdy, J., Is there life after downsizing?

Improving oil and gas decision-making is thus, increasingly, seen as reliant on an understanding of what types of decisions are involved, how they should be made in order to be optimal, and how they actually are made in the ""real world"". There has been significant work carried out within the discipline of cognitive psychology, observing how people actually make decisions. However, little is known as to whether these general observations apply to decision-making in the upstream oil and gas industry. Nor has there been work on how the results might be used to improve decision-making in the industry. This paper documents the development of a theoretical Oil and Gas Decision Making Taxonomy (OGDMT) that seeks to lay a ""level playing field"" decision space within which to judge the processes and tools of optimal decision-making as the first step in this research. The OGDMT builds on established ideas in the human decision-making literature, but is itself novel, and involves four different dimensions: level of investigation; task constraint; value function; and the information structure of the environment. It is concluded that decision scenarios at different places in the taxonomy will likely involve different decision-making tools, data and processes for the achievement of optimal decision-making. The results of this work can be applied, for example, to the question of whether decisions about reserves should be made using deterministic or probabilistic tools, data and processes.

This chapter draws on the field of finance for Enterprise Risk Management (ERM), Real Options Analysis (ROA), Scenario Building (SB), and Scenario Analysis (SA). These techniques and processes are compared to Scenario Planning (SP), a concept, and methodology from strategic management. SP is a strategic management methodology used extensively by senior executives since its application at Royal Dutch Shell in the late 1960s and early 1970s. ERM is a broad approach that has recently become more pervasive in use with the increasing emphasis on improving governance processes in companies. SB is a decision support tool for developing quantitative or qualitative descriptions of alternative outcomes. SA, a sub-set of SB used in finance and accounting, is a means of establishing internally consistent sets of quantitative parameters used as inputs for modeling investment alternatives. Additionally, this chapter draws on the KUU (Known, Unknown, and Unknowable) framework to demonstrate the commonalities and differences among these approaches and calls for their synergistic use. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.",,,"Alessandri, T., Ford, D., Leggio, K., Lander, D., Taylor, M.L., Uncertainty Management in Capital Projects: The Challenges of Implementation; Strategic Decision-Making Contributions from ERM, ROA, KUU, DTA, SM, SWOTs, SP, and CP: Examining Commonalities (2003) Presented as part of the panel Valuing Uncertainty in Capital Budgeting Projects: Alternatives, , Mid west Finance Association, St. Louis; Alessandri, T., Ford, D., Lander, D., Leggio, K., Taylor, M., Managing Risk and Uncertainty in Complex Capital Projects (2004) Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance, 44 (5), p. 75; Alleman, J., Real Options: Management Flexibility and Strategy in Resource Allocation (1999) Information Economics and Policy, 11 (2), pp. 229-235; Amram, M., Kulatilaka, N., (1999) Real Options: Managing Strategic Investment in an Uncertain World, p. 63. , Harvard Business School Press, Boston; Amran, M., Kulatilaka, N., Disciplined Decisions: Aligning Strategy with the Financial Markets (1999) Harvard Business Review; Angelis, D., Capturing the Option Value of R&D (2000) Research Technology Management, 43 (4), pp. 31-34; Anonymous Economics Focus: Keeping all Options Open (1999) Economist, 352 (8132), p. 62; Barton, T.L., Shenkir, W.G., Walker, P.L., (2002) Making Enterprise Risk Management Pay Off: How Leading Companies Implement Risk Management, , Prentice-Hall PTR, Upper Saddle River, NJ; Bernhard, R.H., Real Options: Managerial Flexibility and Strategy in Resource Allocation (2000) Engineering Economist, 45 (2), p. 182; Bernstein, P.L., (1996) Against the Gods-the Remarkable Story of Risk, , John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York; Boer, F.P., Valuation of Technology using 'Real Options' (2000) Research Technology Management, 43 (4), pp. 26-30; Boulton, R.E.S., Libert, B.D., Samek, S.M., (2000) Cracking the Value Code: How Successful Businesses are Creating Value in the New Economy, , Harper Business, New York; Botteron, P., On the Practical Application of the Real Options Theory (2001) Thunderbird International Business Review, 43 (3), pp. 469-479; Brealey, R.A., Myers, S.C., (1996) Principles of Corporate Finance, , McGraw-Hill, New York; Brennan, M., Schwartz, E., Evaluating Natural Resource Investments (1985) Journal of Business, 58 (2), pp. 135-157; Bughin, J., Black-Scholes meets Seinfeld (2000) McKinsey Quarterly, (2), pp. 13-16; Bulow, J., Toeholds and Takeovers (1999) Journal of Political Economy, 107 (3), pp. 427-454; Busby, J.S., Pitts, C.G.C., Real Options and Capital Investment Decisions (1997) Management Accounting (London), 75 (10), pp. 38-39; Chapman, C., Ward, S., (1997) Project Risk Management, , Wiley and Sons, New York; (1990) Competition in Electricity: New Markets and New Structures, , Public Utilities Reports, Inc., QED Research, Inc., Arlington, VA; Palo Alto, CA; Copeland, T., Antikarov, V., (2001) Real Options - A Practitioner's Guide, , Texere LLC, New York; Copeland, T.E., Keenan, P.T., How Much is Flexibility Worth?

Three such dimensions - management as an art or science, strategic emphasis on consistency or flexibility and strategy as a top-down or a bottom-up approach - appear to require difficult choices or compromises between polar extremes. This paper reports on the development of scales to test for predispositions along these dimensions. Results suggest that managers do not necessarily view the polar extremes as mutually exclusive. Implications for managers and future research are discussed.

Though these trials and attempts have covered remarkably broad factors, most of them have weakness and limitations in that focusing relatively narrow perspectives applicable to e-commerce service, applications- level. To resolve these limitations and show broaden perspectives to be considered in clarifying the key success factors for an e-commerce corporate, this paper adopts the concepts and methodologies used in strategic management field such as value chain analysis and balanced scorecard(BSC). By adopting those concepts and methodologies, we try to provide the corporate-level key success factors for e-commerce business. The key success factors for an e-commerce business suggested in this paper are composed of three perspectives: tangible assets, intangible assets and processes. By reflecting many aspects to be considered in clarifying essential competitiveness factors, we give corporate a thorough lookout for key success factors of an e-commerce and suggest a guideline to follow in the course of obtaining competitive advantage in e-commerce industry.","Corporate competence; E-commerce; Key success factors","Balanced scorecard (BSC); Corporate competence; Key success factors; Industrial economics; Industrial management; Marketing; Telecommunication services; Electronic commerce","(1999) The Emerging Digital Economy II, , U.S. Department of Commerce, Department of commerce, Washington DC; Gary, P., (2002) New Perspectives on E-commerce, Course Technology, , Boston, MA; Wigand, R., (1997) Electronic Commerce: Definition, Theory, and Context, 13, pp. 1-16. , The information Society; Kalakota, R., Whinston, A., (1997) Electronic Commerce-A Manager's Guide, , Massachusetts : Addison-Wesley Longman; Murths, T., Country capabilities and strategic state: How national political institutions affect MNC strategies (1998) Strategic Management Journal, 15, pp. 113-129; D'Cruz, Rugman, A., (1992) New Concepts for Canadian Competitiveness, , Kodak, Canada; Ajitabh, Momaya, Competitiveness of forms: Review of theory, frameworks and models Singapore Management Review, 26 (1), pp. 45-61; Buckley, P., Foreign market servicing strategies and competitiveness (1991) Journal of Marketing Management, 17 (2), pp. 34-46; Bartlett, A., Ghoshal, S., (1989) Managing Across Borders, , Harvard business School Press, Boston, MA; Doz, Y., Prahalad, C., (1987) The Multinational Mission, , New York, The Free Press; Hamel, G., Prahalad, C., Strategic intent (1989) HBR, 3, pp. 63-76; Prahalad, C., Hamel, G., The key success factors of the corporation (1990) Harvard Business Review, 68, pp. 79-91; Grant, R., (1991) Contemporary Strategy Analysis: Concepts, Techniques and Applications, , Blackwell Ltd., Ambridge, MA; Barney, J., Wright, M., Ketchen, D., The resource-based view of enterprise: Ten years after 1991 (2001) Journal of Management, 27, pp. 625-641. , Pergamon; Barney, J., Enterprise resources and sustained competitive advantage (1991) Journal of Management, 17 (1), pp. 99-120; Peteraf, M.A., The cornerstones of competitive advantage: A resource-based view (1993) Strategic Management Journal, 14, pp. 179-191; Smith, S., World class competitiveness (1995) Managing Service Quality, 5 (5), pp. 36-42; Johnson, H.T., (1992) Relevance Regained, , The Free Press, New York, NY; Hammer, M., Champy, J., (1993) Re-engineering the Corporation, , Harper Businesses, New York; Corbett, C., Wassenhove, L., Trade offs?

We argue that the challenges related to e-government adoption can be partially attributed to the lack of standard collaboration practices between government agencies. We use the case of the foreign financing decision making process in Egypt as an example of a government process where close collaboration between government agencies such as ministries and the central bank of Egypt is essential. Our research identified a number of organizational and interorganizational problems such as difficulties in tracking and documenting the decision making process across different departments within and across government agencies. Based on our empirical findings, this paper proposes a framework for effective inter-governmental collaboration in the case of the Egyptian government in particular and egovernment adoption in general. © 2006 IEEE.","Decision making processes; Developing countries; e-govemment; Integration; Inter-governmental collaboration","Decision making processes; E-govemment; Inter-governmental collaboration; Inter-organizational integration; Decision making; Finance; Industrial management; International cooperation; Public policy; Computer supported cooperative work","Beaumont, P., Longley, P.A., Maguire, D.J., Geographic information portals - A UK perspective (2005) Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 29 (1), pp. 49-69. , January; Bevnon-Davies, P., Constructing electronic government: The case of the UK inland revenue International Journal of Information Management, , http:www.swan.ac.uk/ebms/staff/paul/PBDCPaps.htm, Article in Press, Corrected Proof, Available online 17 November 2004; Carrier, L., Managing at light speed (1999) IEEE Computer, 32 (7), pp. 107-109; Chen, L.M., Gillenson, M.L., Sherrell, D.L., Enticing online consumers: An extended technology acceptance perspective (2002) Information & Management, 39 (8), pp. 705-719. , September; Corkery, J., International experience with institutional development and administrative reform: Some pointers for success (1997) ECDPM Working Paper No. 15, 15. , Maastricht: ECDPM; Courtney, H., Kirk, J., Viguerie, P., Strategy under uncertainty (1997) Harvard Business Review, 75 (6), pp. 67-81; Cyert, R., Kumar, P.K., Williams, J.R., Information market imperfection and strategy (1993) Strategic Management Journal, 14 (WINTER SPEC.

These differ primarily on the appropriate role of prediction in the decision process. Prediction is a central issue in strategy making owing to the presumption that what can be predicted can be controlled. In this paper we argue for the independence of prediction and control. This implies that the pursuit of successful outcomes can occur through control-oriented approaches that may essentially be non-predictive. We further develop and highlight control-oriented approaches with particular emphasis on the question of what organizations should do next. We also explore how these approaches may impact the costs and risks of firm strategies as well as the firm's continual efforts to innovate.

Since strategic management is an applied discipline this is a serious criticism. However, we argue that the theory-practice question is too simple. Accordingly, this paper expands this question by outlining first the theoretical criteria under which strategy theory is not actionable, and then outlines an alternative perspective on strategy knowledge in action, based upon a practice epistemology. The paper is in three sections. The first section explains two contextual conditions which impact upon strategy theory within a knowledge economy, environmental velocity and knowledge intensity. The impact of these contextual conditions upon the application of four different streams of strategy theory is examined. The second section suggests that the theoretical validity of these contextual conditions breaks down when we consider the knowledge artifacts, such as strategy tools and frameworks, which arise from strategy research. The third section proposes a practice epistemology for analyzing strategy knowledge in action that stands in contrast to more traditional arguments about actionable knowledge. From a practice perspective, strategy knowledge is argues to be actionable as part of the everyday activities of strategizing. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on a literature review, an integrative framework is developed encompassing key antecedents, process and outcome factors, and the interrelationship among them. The review reveals that strategy-process research has made considerable progress in the past, shifting the focus from strategic planning to new areas, thereby emphasizing the exposed position of the individuals involved. The authors recommend that researchers conduct more studies that explore the effects of the individuals involved in strategy processes and the phases prior to and after the actual decision making.","Literature review; Strategic decision making; Strategy process",,"Alexander, M., Planning for planners (1995) Long Range Planning, 28 (3), pp. 101-104; Amason, A.C., Distinguishing the effects of functional and dysfunctional conflict on strategic decision making (1996) Academy of Management Journal, 39, pp. 123-148; Amason, A.C., Sapienza, H.J., The effects of top management team size and interaction norms on cognitive and affective conflict (1997) Journal of Management, 23, pp. 495-516; Amatucci, F.M., Grant, J.H., Eight strategic decisions that weakened Gulf Oil (1993) Long Range Planning, 26 (1), pp. 98-110; Andersen, T.J., Strategic planning, autonomous actions and corporate performance (2000) Long Range Planning, 33, pp. 184-200; Andersen, T.J., Integrating decentralized strategy making and strategic planning processes in dynamic environments (2004) Journal of Management Studies, 41, pp. 1271-1299; Andrews, K.R., (1971) The Concept of Corporate Strategy, , Homewood, IL: Irwin; Ansoff, H.I., (1965) Corporate Strategy, , New York: McGraw-Hill; Ansoff, H.I., Comment on Henry Mintzberg's rethinking strategic planning (1994) Long Range Planning, 27 (3), pp. 31-32; Armstrong, J.S., The value of formal planning for strategic decisions: Review of empirical research (1982) Strategic Management Journal, 3, pp. 197-211; Asch, D., Strategic control: A problem looking for a solution (1992) Long Range Planning, 25 (2), pp. 105-110; Ashmos, D.P., Duchon, D., McDaniel, J., Reuben, R., Participation in strategic decision making: The role of organizational predisposition and issue (1998) Decision Sciences, 29, pp. 25-51; Ashmos, D.P., McDaniel Jr., R.R., Understanding the participation of critical task specialists in strategic decision making (1996) Decision Sciences, 27, pp. 103-121; Atuahene-Gima, K., Haiyang, L., Strategic decision comprehensiveness and new product development outcomes in new technology ventures (2004) Academy of Management Journal, 47, pp. 583-597; Audia, P.G., Locke, E.A., Smith, K.G., The paradox of success: An archival and a laboratory study of strategic persistence following radical environmental change (2000) Academy of Management Journal, 43, pp. 837-853; Bacharach, S.B., Bamberger, P., Mundell, B., Strategic and tactical logics of decision justification: Power and decision criteria in organizations (1995) Human Relations, 48, pp. 467-488; Baker Jr., F.E., Strategic planning in a U.S. federal agency (1992) Long Range Planning, 25 (5), pp. 73-79; Baker, W.H., Addams, H.L., Davis, B., Business planning in successful small firms (1993) Long Range Planning, 26 (6), pp. 82-88; Bamberger, P., Fiegenbaum, A., The role of strategic reference points in explaining the nature and consequences of human resource strategy (1996) Academy of Management Review, 21, pp. 926-958; Banfield, P., Jennings, P.L., Beaver, G., Competence-based training for small firms - An expensive failure?

The article deals with risk and uncertainty in strategic decision making. First the concepts of risk and uncertainty and possibilities of their measurement are discussed. Further shortcomings of strategic decision making from the point of view risk integration are described. The emphasis is on discussion of decision making methods under risk and uncertainty (including decision tables, scenarios, Monte Carlo simulation, real options, decision trees, multicriteria utility function under risk, theory of games and methods of portfolio development) as supporting tools for strategic decision making. In the last part of the article some recommendations for integration of risk and un certainty in strategic decision making based on scenario approach are suggested.","Decision support; Risk; Risk measurement; Scenario planning; Strategic decision making; Uncertainty",,"Borglin, A., Keiding, H., Stochastic dominance and conditional expectation - An insurance theoretical approach (2002) Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance Theory, 1, pp. 31-48; Brandao, L.E., Dyer, J.S., Hahn, W.J., Using decision analysis to solve real option valuation problems: Building a generalized approach (2004) Decision Analysis, 4, pp. 1-31; Bunn, D., Thomas, H., Decision analysis and strategic policy formulation (1977) Long Range Planning, 10, pp. 23-35; Courtney, H., Kirkland, J., Viguerie, P., Strategy under uncertainty (1997) Harvard Business Review, 6, pp. 66-79; Černý, M., Gluckaufová, D., (1982) Vícekriteriální Vyhodnocování v Praxi, , Praha, SNTL; De Wit, B., Meyer, R., (1995) Strategy (Process, Content, Context), , New York, West Publishing Company; Fiala, P., Jablonský, J., Maňas, M., (1997) Vícekriteriální Rozhodování, , Praha, VŠE; Forno, A., Montrucchio, L., Optimality conditions and bubbles in sequential economies and bounded relative risk-aversion (2003) Decisions in Economics and Finance, (1), pp. 53-80; Foster, M.J., Scenario planning for small business (1993) Longe Range Planning, 1, pp. 123-130; Fotr, J., Rozhodovaci analýza: Pojeti, formy, aplikace (1987) Ekonomicko - Matematický Obzor, 2, pp. 136-154. , Praha, Academia; Fotr, J., Dědina, J., Hruzová, H., (2003) Manažerské Rozhodování, , Praha, Ekopress; Fotr, J., Pišek, M., (1986) Exaktní Metody Ekonomického Rozhodování, , Praha, Academia; Fotr, J., Souček, I., (2005) Podnikatelský Záměr A Investiční Rozhodování, , Praha, Grada; Fuld, L., Be prepared (2003) Harvard Business Review, 11, pp. 20-21; Goodwin, P., Wright, G., (2004) Decision Analysis for Management Judgement, , West Sussex, John Wiley; Gros, I., (2003) Kvantitativni Metody v Manažerském Rozhodování, , Praha, Grada Publishing; Hammond, J.S., Keeney, R.L., Raiffa, H., (1999) Smart Choices.

However, successfully increasing carbon storage while maintaining economic profitability is challenging because of the long planning horizons required for many forest activities and slow carbon sequestration rates in northern forests. The literature on the economics of forest management for carbon storage is unfortunately sparse and, in many instances, confused and misleading. Three carbon valuation equations are widely used that give contradictory results, with two of them (flow summation and average storage) ignoring the time-value carbon benefits and other essential data. Only the discounted carbon equation gives reasonably interpretable economic results. As well, many studies have omitted essential economic gradients that result in structurally questionable results. I review the literature, highlighting deficiencies in equations and how analyses are structured with the intent to produce a reasonable method of interpreting previous work and advice for future studies. © 2006 NRC.",,"Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Carbon sequestration rate; Carbon storage; Forest land; Forestry; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; forest management; Kyoto Protocol; resource economy; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Chelation; Climates; Forestry","Adams, D.M., Alig, R.J., McCarl, B.A., Callaway, J.M., Winnett, S.M., Minimum cost strategies for sequestering carbon in forests (1999) Land Econ., 75, pp. 360-374; Alig, R., Adams, D., McCarl, B., Callaway, J.M., Winnett, S., Assessing effects of mitigation strategies for global climate change with an intertemporal model of US forest and agriculture sectors (1997) Environ.

Design/methodology/approach – A combination of scenario planning with technology road-mapping, expert analysis and creative group processes. The techniques described can be integrated with traditional tools of strategic technology planning. The paper presents a short illustrative case study and examples from practice. Findings – Scenario techniques can be successfully applied to analysing disruptive innovation. Practical implications – Scenario techniques help guide managers to more effective decision making by preparing for a wide range of uncertainty and by counteracting typical biases of over-optimism and decision “framing”. The techniques presented can be used in executive development and in strategic planning for innovative and high-tech industries. Originality/value – This paper presents a novel way to combine scenario methods with technology road-mapping and creative group analysis.

As a result of its impact, SARS quickly established itself as a new kind of global uncertainty and posed challenges for traditional methods of risk management. This article examines the impact that SARS has had through means of a case study and builds on this to provide recommendations for how uncertainty may be managed in an increasingly globalized world. Reconsideration of strategic and risk-management approaches have become necessary. Supply-chain management and corporate strategy require a fundamental rethink to balance the pursuit of efficiency with increased responsiveness and flexibility. Unpredictability and turbulence in the international business environment suggest that traditional planning approaches that assume linear growth may give way to more scenario-based planning. This will encourage firms to contemplate a variety of possible futures and better prepare them for unanticipated events. Similarly, contingent-based continuity plans help businesses continue running even during a crisis. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,"Aldred, C., Virus challenges efficacy of risk management plans (2003) Business Insurance, 37 (23), p. 9; Ben-Ami, D., The cost of SARS (2003), http://www.spiked-online.com/Articles/00000006DD8A.htm, (May 7).

Design/methodology/approach - The approach taken is a conceptualization of the internationalization decision framed from theoretical reasoning and informed by the literature. Findings - The model presents the internationalization decision, a product/market/mode (PMM) combination, in the case of a terrorism-free context and in a with-terrorism context. Using indifference curve mapping of risk/return tradeoffs, an opportunities set of possible PMM combinations and the notion of efficiency, it traces the most attractive opportunities set to show that within this set, the frontier of attractive opportunities is constrained in the with-terrorism case. Propositions are framed to guide future research. While conditions of risk can be calculated, it is concluded that remaining uncalculable is the true uncertainty incited by the systemic effects of international terrorism that call for managerial judgment. Originality/value - The literature in this field reports little on the effects of international terrorism on the firm. With heightened awareness of international terrorism, and the changed environment for the firm operating internationally, it is timely that the effects of terrorism on decision-making in firms be investigated. Advancing beyond description to substantive conceptualization of this decision is an essential step for better understanding of this now pervasive phenomenon. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Decision making; Risk management; Terrorism; Uncertainty management",,"Adner, R., Levinthal, D., ""What is not a real option: Considering boundaries for the application of real options to business strategy"" (2004) Academy of Management Review, 29 (1), pp. 74-85; Agarwal, S., Ramaswami, S., ""Choice of foreign market entry mode: Impact of ownership, location and internalization factors"" (1992) Journal of International Business Studies, 23 (1), pp. 1-27; Aggarwal, R., ""Investment performance of US-based multinational companies: Comments and a perspective on international diversification of real assets"" (1980) Journal of International Business Studies, 11 (1), pp. 98-104; Alexander, Y., Valton, D., Wilkinson, P., (1979) Terrorism: Theory and Practice, , Westview Press Boulder, CO; Amram, M., Kulatilaka, N., (1999) Real Options: Managing Strategic Investment in an Uncertain World, , Harvard Business School Press Boston, MA; Balabanis, G., Diamantopoulos, A., Mueller, R.D., Melewar, T.C., ""The impact of nationalism, patriotism and internationalism on consumer ethnocentric tendencies"" (2001) Journal of International Business Studies, 2 (1), pp. 157-175; Barney, J., ""Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage"" (1991) Journal of Management, 17 (1), pp. 99-120; Barton, L., ""Terrorism as an international business crisis"" (1993) Management Decision, 31 (1), pp. 22-26; Becker, G., Rubinstein, Y., ""Fear and the response to terrorism: An economic analysis"" (2004), available at: www.cornell.edu/international/events/upload/ BeckerrubinsteinPaperBenito, G., Welch, L., ""De-internationalization"" (1997) Management International Review, 2, pp. 7-25; Blomberg, S.B., Hes, G.D., Orphanides, A., ""The macroeconomic consequences of terrorism"" (2004) Journal of Monetary Economics, 51 (5), pp. 1007-1032; Buckley, P.J., Ghauri, P.N., ""Globalisation, economic geography and the strategy of MNEs"" (2004) Journal of International Business Studies, 3 (2), pp. 81-98; Casson, M., (2000) Economics of International Business, , Edward Elgar Cheltenham; Chen, N., Roli, R., Ross, S., ""Economic forces and the stock market"" (1986) Journal of Business, 59 (3), pp. 383-403; Collis, D., ""A resource-based analysis of global competition"" (1991) Strategic Management Journal, 12, pp. 49-68; Courtney, H., Kirkland, J., Viguerie, P., ""Strategy under uncertainty"" (1997) Harvard Business Review, pp. 67-79. , November-December; Cowan, L., ""Economic impact of terrorist acts worries wealthy"" (2004) The Wall Street Journal, pp. D9. , June 9; Dawes, R.M., (1988) Rational Choice in an Uncertain World, , Harcourt Brace Jovanovich New York, NY; Deen, T., ""Global slump hits developing nations hardest"" (2002) Asia Times Online, , June 28; Dixit, A., Pindyck, R., (1994) Investment Under Uncertainty, , Princeton University Press Princeton, NJ; Dunning, J., ""The eclectic paradigm of international production: A restatement and some possible extensions"" (1988) Journal of International Business Studies, 19, pp. 1-31; Eckstein, Z., Tsiddon, D., ""Macroeconomic consequences of terror: Theory and the case of Israel"" (2004) Journal of Monetary Economics, 51 (5), pp. 971-1002; ""Finance and economics: The rational response to terrorism"" (2005) The Economist, 376 (8436), p. 76. , (The) Economist July 23; Evans, J., Archer, S.H., ""Diversification and the reduction of dispersion: An empirical analysis"" (1968) Journal of Finance, 23 (5), pp. 761-767; Fama, E.F., ""Risk, return and equilibrium"" (1971) Journal of Political Economy, 79 (1), pp. 30-55; Gardner, R.N., Vambury, R.G., ""Progress towards a new world economic order"" (1975) Journal of International Business Studies, 6, pp. 5-14; Ghemawat, P., ""Semiglobalization and international business strategy"" (2003) Journal of International Business Studies, 34 (2), pp. 138-152; Globerman, S., Shapiro, D., ""Governance infrastructure and US foreign direct investment"" (2003) Journal of International Business Studies, 34 (1), pp. 19-39; Gulamhussen, M., ""Real options in international business"" (2000) Economics of International Business, pp. 189-227. , Casson, M.

Design/methodology/approach - The Miles and Snow strategic orientation typology was used to examine the emphasis on the factors used to craft strategy and its subsequent impact on organizational performance. The study examined its applicability in two contrasting sectors: engineering and electronics. Findings - Based on the responses obtained from 194 SMEs, the findings indicate that the main strategic orientation types present in this study are associated with different environment types; prospectors tend to perceive their environment as ""dynamic"" whereas defenders perceive their environment as ""stable"". Distinct differences were found in relation to the emphasis of both orientation types on leadership, culture, strategy, and performance outcomes. Finally, the findings indicate that ""prospectors"" perform better than ""defenders"" and are twice as likely to be high performing. Smaller firms are more likely to be ""prospectors"" compared with firms employing over 100 staff. Originality/value - The study confirms the applicability of the Miles and Snow typology to SMEs - a domain neglected in previous studies. The findings also depict the association between the attributes of the operating environment, organizational culture, leadership and strategy on both defenders and prospectors and the path to either high or low performance. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business performance; Corporate strategy; Small to medium-sized enterprises","Business performance; Corporate strategy; Small to medium-sized enterprises; Strategic orientation typology; Industrial management; Industrial plants; Performance; Product design; Societies and institutions; Strategic planning; Electronic equipment manufacture","Barney, J.B., Strategic factor markets: Expectations, luck and business strategy (1986) Management Science, 32 (10), pp. 1231-1241; Barney, J.B., (2002) Gaining and Sustaining Competitive Advantage, , Prentice-Hall Englewood Cliffs, NJ; Begley, T.M., Boyd, D.P., Executive and corporate correlates of financial performance in smaller firms (1986) Journal of Small Business Management, 24 (2), pp. 8-15; Bennis, W., Nanus, B., (1985) Leaders: The Strategies for Taking Charge, , Harper and Row New York, NY; Boyd, K.B., Dess, G.G., Rasheed, A.M.A., Divergence between perceptual and archival measures of the environment: Causes and consequences (1993) Academy of Management Review, 18, pp. 204-226; Brown, A.D., (1995) Organisational Culture, , Pitman London; Chattopadhyay, P., Glick, W., Miller, C.C., Huber, G., Determinants of executive beliefs: Comparing functional conditioning and social influences (1999) Strategic Management Journal, 20 (8), pp. 763-789; Conant, J.S., Mokwa, M.P., Varadarajan, P.R., Strategic types, distinctive marketing competencies and organizational performance: A multiple measures-based study (1990) Strategic Management Journal, 11, pp. 365-383; Courtney, H., Kirkland, J., Viguerie, P., Strategy under uncertainty (1997) Harvard Business Review, 75 (6), pp. 67-79; Daft, R.L., Weick, K.E., Toward a model of organizations as interpretation systems (1984) Academy of Management Review, 9 (2), pp. 284-295; Daily, C.M., McDougall, Covin, J.G., Dalton, D.R., Governance and strategic leadership in entrepreneurial firms (2002) Journal of Management, 28 (3), pp. 387-412; Davig, W., Business strategies in smaller manufacturing firms (1986) Journal of Small Business Management, 24 (1), pp. 38-46; Day, D.V., Lord, R.G., Executive leadership and organizational performance: Suggestion for a new theory and methodology (1988) Journal of Management, 14, pp. 453-464; Desarbo, W.S., Di Benedetto, A., Song, M., Sinha, I., Revisiting the Miles and Snow strategic framework: Uncovering interrelationships between strategic types, capabilities, environmental uncertainty, and firm performance (2005) Strategic Management Journal, 26, pp. 47-74; Doty, D.H., Glick, H.W., Huber, P.G., Fit, equifinallity, and organizational effectiveness: A test of two configurational theories (1993) Academy of Management Journal, 36 (6), pp. 1196-1250; (1996) Small Firms in Britain Report, , Department of Trade and Industry London; Durand, R., Vargas, V.A., Ownership, organization and private firms efficient use of resources (2003) Strategic Management Journal, 24, pp. 667-675; Dvir, D., Segev, E., Shenhar, A., Technology's varying impact on the success of strategic business units within the Miles and Snow typology (1993) Strategic Management Journal, 14, pp. 155-162; Farjoun, M., Towards an organic perspective on strategy (2002) Strategic Management Journal, 23 (7), pp. 561-594; Fox-Wolfgramm, S.J., Boal, B.K., Hunt, J.G., Organizational adaptation to institutional change: A comparative study of first-order change in prospector and defender banks (1998) Administrative Science Quarterly, 43, pp. 87-126; Gale, B.T., Buzzell, R.D., Market position and competitive strategy (1993) The Interface of Marketing and Strategy, , Day, G.

The environment is defined using the STEP concept (society, technology, economy and politics) and Porter's five forces model. The relationship between the perception of the external farm environment and the strategy farmers choose for their farm is quantified to gain insight into the effect of the external farm environment on decision-making. Data from a survey of 103 Dutch dairy farmers was analyzed using regression analysis. The results indicate that environmental uncertainty is not related to complexity or dynamism, but to the illiberality (i.e., intolerance, hostility) of the external farm environment. The institutional environment is considered especially illiberal, thus causing high uncertainty. Farmers with high PEU are more likely to choose a diversification strategy, while low perceived uncertainty results in a process-control strategy for the farm. A growth strategy is not affected by perceived environmental uncertainty. The PE and PEU approach is new in agricultural research and shows that the farmer's view on the external environment is a key issue for decision-making on farms The significant relationship between the perceived uncertainty caused by the external farm environment and farm strategies shows that to get a good understanding of the farm, farming system boundaries should be expanded to incorporate the effect of the external farm environment on decision making. Reduction of uncertainty will enhance decision-making because instead of farming within an uncertain context, risk management practices can be used. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this paper is to evaluate and present best practice strategies employed by major retail organisations concerning these deployments. The paper argues that Tesco's superior performance can be identified through five critical factors. However, continued success using existing models and thinking is problematic and that future advantages will rely on taking a complex adaptive systems view of the deployment of E-Grocery systems. Design/methodology/ approach: The methodology employed is a conceptual synthesis of current knowledge, based on theoretical constructs and empirical observations. Findings: There is evidence of varying degrees of progress and lessons learnt, from adopting strategies and internet technologies, with new ways of conceptualizing and managing virtual retail operations. The research challenges existing thinking and makes sense of the plexus between this technology and the market place. Originality/value: The essential contribution of the paper is the identification of five key elements for online retail success and the development of a proposed ""online sustainability"" model which is perceived to offer contemporary insights into competitive virtual environments. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Internet shopping; Retailing; Supermarkets; United Kingdom",,"Amit, R., Zott, C., Value creation from eBusines (2001) Strategic Management Journal, 22, pp. 493-520; Chiang, W.K., Dhhajed, D., Hess, J.D., Direct marketing, indirect profits: A strategic analysis of dual - Channel supply chain design (2003) Management Science, 49 (1), pp. 1-20; Courtney, H., Kirkland, J., Viguerie, P., Strategy under uncertainty (1997) Harvard Business Review, 75 (6), pp. 66-79; Dales, T., Meagher, N., Avenues for growth (2002) The Grocer Yearbook, pp. 21-2; Davis, G., Tesco refuses to be overtaken in Net grocery race (2002) Retail Week, p. 14. , March 8; Delaney-Klinger, K., Boyer, K.K., Frohlich, M., The return of on-line grocery shopping: A comparative analysis of Webvan and Tesco's operational methods (2003) The TQM Magazine, 15 (3), pp. 187-96; Evans, M., Food retailing loyalty schemes (1999) British Food Journal, 101 (2), pp. 132-47; Evans, P., Wurster, T.S., Strategy and the new economics of information (1997) Harvard Business Review, pp. 71-82. , September-October; Evans, P., Wurster, T.S., Getting real about virtual commerce (1999) Harvard Business Review, pp. 85-94. , November-December; Evans, P., Wurster, T.S., (2000) Blown to Bits: How the New Economics of Information Transforms Strategy, , Harvard Business School Press Boston, MA; Fernie, J., Pierrel, R.A., Own branding in UK and French supermarkets (1996) Journal of Product & Brand Management, 5 (3), pp. 48-59; Times, F., Retail round up - Waitrose is poised to overtake Sainsbury's to become the UK's second biggest on-line grocer (2004) Financial Times, , 21 December; Gannaway, B., Ahead of the game?

The integrative literature review revealed that innovation can enhance profitability if not pursued with fragmentation of an organization's core identity.

Therefore, it would seem reasonable for radiologists to believe that the emergence of a new imaging technology can generally be foreseen with sufficient advance notice to allow the appropriate levels of time, effort, and money to be devoted toward incorporating it into radiology practice. However, in his seminal work, Christiansen characterized a new form of technologic innovation, known as ""disruptive technology,"" whose emergence often heralds the replacement of market leaders in an industry by competitors who are quicker in adopting and deploying the new technology. This article briefly describes the phenomenon of disruptive technology and addresses the challenges that organizations face in dealing with disruptive technology. The article raises 4 questions about the future of radiology: (1) Are health care and radiology vulnerable to disruptive technology? (2) What kinds of change may be in store for the radiology profession? (3) Can the radiology profession prepare itself to recognize and respond to a disruptive innovation among a group of new imaging technologies? and (4) How should a radiology organization decide whether to invest significant resources in a potentially disruptive technology? This article addresses these questions by reviewing key insights from leading ""gurus"" in the fields of competitive strategy and technology management and applying them to radiology. This illustrates how and why (despite past successes) the radiology profession may still have a blind spot in recognizing and handling disruptive technologies. © 2006 American College of Radiology.","disruptive technology; industry change; Strategy","article; computer assisted radiography; computer assisted tomography; diagnostic imaging; health care delivery; human; medical practice; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; radiodiagnosis","Smith, D.K., Alexander, R.C., (1988) Fumbling the future: how Xerox invented, then ignored, the first personal computer, , Morrow, New York, NY; Christiansen, C.M., Raynor, M.E., (2003) The innovator's solution: creating and sustaining successful growth, , Harvard Business School Press, Boston, Mass; Brown, J.S., Duiguid, P., (2000) The social life of information, , Harvard Business School Press, Boston, Mass; Hillman, B.J., The diffusion of new imaging technologies: a molecular imaging prospective (2006) J Am Coll Radiol, 3, pp. 33-37; Kwak, M., Yoffie, (1998) The browser wars, 1994-1998, case 9-798-094, , Harvard Business School Press, Boston, Mass; Christiansen, C.M., (1997) The innovator's dilemma: when new technologies cause great firms to fail, , Harvard Business School Press, Boston, Mass; Nelson, R.R., Winter, S.G., (1982) An evolutionary theory of economic change, , Belknap, Cambridge, Mass; Tichy, N.M., Cohen, E., (1997) The leadership engine: how winning companies build leaders at every level, , HarperCollins, New York, NY; Burgelman, R.A., (2002) Strategy is destiny: how strategy-making shapes a company's future, , Free Press, New York, NY; McGrath, R.G., MacMillan, I., (2000) The entrepreneurial mindset: strategies for continuously creating opportunity in an age of uncertainty, , Harvard Business School Press, Boston, Mass; Senge, P.M., (1990) The fifth discipline: the art and practice of the learning organization, , Doubleday, New York, NY; Watkins, K., Marsick, V.J., (1993) Sculpting the learning organization; lessons in the art and science of systemic change, , Jossey-Bass, San Francisco, Calif; Welch, J., Byrne, J., (2001) Jack: straight from the gut, , Warner Books, New York, NY; Pietersen, W., (2002) Reinventing strategy: using strategic learning to create and sustain breakthrough performance, , John Wiley, New York, NY; Christiansen, C.M., Anthony, S.D., Roth, E.A., (2004) Seeing what's next: using the theories of innovation to predict industry change, , Harvard Business School Press, Boston, Mass; Christiansen, C.M., Bohmer, R., Kenagy, J., Will disruptive technologies cure health care?

Perceived uncertainties that hinder the innovation decisions of involved actors play a key role in this process. Determining how perceived uncertainties differ between types of actors and between transformation phases (pre-development, take-off, acceleration, stabilisation) can provide essential insights for managing such transformations. This article aims at presenting a framework for analysing the role of uncertainties in socio-technological transformations. In this framework, we classify uncertainties according to their source (technology, resources, competitors, suppliers, consumers, politics), nature (knowledge, variability) and level (low to high) and relate this uncertainty typology to the different transformation phases and involved actors. Finally, we discuss implications for policy. © 2006 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","innovation; perceived uncertainty; socio-technological transformation; transformation phases; uncertainty typology",,"Afuah, A.N., Utterback, J.M., Responding to structural industry changes: a technological evolution perspective (1997) Industrial and Corporate Change, 6, pp. 183-202; Anderson, P., Tushman, M.L., Technological discontinuities and organizational environments (1986) Administrative Science Quarterly, 31 (3), pp. 439-465; Anderson, P., Tushman, M.L., Technological discontinuities and dominant designs: a cyclical model of technological change (1990) Administrative Science Quarterly, 35 (4), pp. 604-633; Arthur, W.B., Competing technologies: an overview (1988) Technical Change and Economic Theory, pp. 590-607. , G.

We will elaborate on the roles, positions and strategies of different actors involved in socio-technological transformation in a future articleIn our definition, ambiguity – the existence of different interpretations of an issue – is also included in the term ‘uncertainty’The distinction between knowledge uncertainty and variability uncertainty is not sharp. Variability uncertainty contributes to knowledge uncertainty: due to variability, perfect knowledge and certain predictions are anyhow unattainable (Van Asselt, 2000). But knowledge uncertainty can also exist in deterministic processes (e.g. due to a lack of communication, inexact measurements or too high complexity)E.g. resulting from a lack of communication (Williamson, 1987)Although each researcher uses his own conceptualisation, we have grouped those concepts that appeared closely related. For example, Jennings and Jones (1999) speak about uncertainty regarding labour and capital markets, which we have assigned to ‘resource uncertainty’See note 1The third uncertainty that was mentioned was uncertainty about the lead-time of the nuclear power plant relative to the coal-fired plant, which was influenced by increased uncertainty about regulations. Uncertainty about regulations is a component of political uncertainty, as we will discuss belowThis cause of technological uncertainty can also be found in the description of ‘action uncertainty’ by Van Asselt (2000) and by Moenaert and Souder (1990) in their description of technological uncertainty as ‘a lack of knowledge about technological solutions’See note 1The difference between competitive uncertainty and technological uncertainty caused by the possibility of choosing alternative technological solutions is that competitive uncertainty refers to the actions of competing firms while technological uncertainty refers to the characteristics of competing technologiesFirst mover advantages afford greater returns to a firm that acts before another firm, while economies of scale afford greater returns to a firm that invests more. In general, the greater the number of competitors, the greater the incentive to act early or to focus investments (Wernerfelt and Karnani, 1987)Supplier uncertainty can be attributed to external availability and quality of goods and services (such as knowledge), whereas resource uncertainty (discussed below) relates to the availability of capital and knowledge internal to the organisationCollaborating with other actors (such as suppliers, competitors, research institutes or consumer organisations) may not only help in reducing uncertainty about the behaviour of this actor, but also in coping with other sources of uncertainty (such as sharing uncertainty about financial resources)Other actors instead of government can also create uncertainty if there is a discrepancy between what they say and what they doIn follow up research this framework will be used in empirical case studies involving the transformation towards a sustainable energy systemThe dominant source is the source that is perceived as most important by the actorSince this component is equal in all phases, we have chosen not to take this component into account in our assessment. Therefore, the acceleration and stabilisation phase are given 0 instead of +. The same holds for uncertainty about (unpredictable) changes in policy (a component of political uncertainty). Note that this is only an exemplary description of the pattern we expect to findWe expect that uncertainty about financial resources will probably be less important in the pre-development phase, since the investments are then relatively small and will be funded from the R&D budget of the firm and/or from public funding. In the acceleration and the stabilisation phases, the financial uncertainty will probably also be relatively unimportant, since the firms that have survived the shake-out regarding the number of competitors are making profit and hardly have to invest anymoreIn the pre-development phase, technology-developers will be uncertain which firms will bring a competitive technology on the market, how these competing technologies will perform and which strategies these competing firms will use. However, competitive uncertainty is less dominant in this phase in comparison with the take-off phase. In the acceleration and stabilisation phases, competitive uncertainty will be less important compared to the previous phases, since firms know who their competitors are and what their strategy isIn the pre-development phase, technology-developers will try to anticipate the consumers’ expectations regarding the new technology. Since potential consumers are unable to clearly articulate their expectations and needs regarding the new technology, technology-developers will perceive consumer uncertainty. However, in this phase technological uncertainty dominates over consumer uncertainty. In the acceleration phase, consumer uncertainty is low. In the stabilisation phase, the market becomes saturated and technology-developers will be uncertain how to retain their market share. As a result, consumer uncertainty will become more important againIn the pre-development phase, technology-developers have the option of making prototypes in-house, without the requirement of specialised components from suppliers. In the stabilisation phase, only minor changes take place, thus, we expect supplier uncertainty to be relatively small in these phasesSee note 19",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-34147132436

Due to versatility of MVNO, its advent is expected to create many new service providers, allowing them to launch their businesses in emerging mobile market. But the future business Environments for potential MVNOs are very uncertain due to the different interests of the stakeholders. In order to deal with such uncertainties, enterprises must focus on their business strategy to more than on simple and alleged exact prognostic future environments. From this perspective, we discussed various aspects of MVNO and developed three coherent MVNO market scenarios such as 'Liberalized Advanced Market Scenario', 'Predatory Competition Market Scenario' and 'Segmented Niche Market Scenario'. On the basis of the proposed scenarios, we formulated some implications for market strategy of potential MVNOs.","Market Scenarios; MVNO; Scenario Planning","Mobile telecommunication systems; Strategic planning; Virtual reality; Mobile phones; Planning; Market Scenarios; MVNO; Scenario Planning; Marketing; Commerce; Business environments; Business strategy; Market strategies; Mobile markets; Mobile virtual network operator; MVNO; Niche markets; Scenario Planning","Kim, J.-G., Analysis of oversea examples to examine feasibility of MVON model introduction (2002) Information &amp; Telecommunication Policy Journal 14th Issue, , 14th Volume; Kim, B.-J., Background of MVNO introduction in key foreign countries Information & Telecommunication Policy Journal 2004-9-1; Kim, B.-W., Kwon, S.-C., Analysis of MVNO model profitability in mobile communication service market (2004) Information Technology Research Series, 4 (1). , 1; Suggested measures to improve classification systems of communication services and service operators (2002) Discussion Materials, , 6.27; (2003) Status of Communication Service Market and Competition Policy Directions, , 7.24; (2003) Status of Subscribers to Wire and Wireless Communication Services, , 7.24; Shim, Y.-W., Im, B.-R., Kim, M.-Y., MVNO status in key foreign countries and suggestions to policy directions on local mobile communication service market (2004) SK Telecom Issue Analysis, 4 (4); (2004) Policy Review Started for Introduction of MVON Model, , 6.3; (2001) Mobile Virtual Network Operators- Partneimg for Success, , 10; Courtney, H., (2001) 20/20 Foresight: Crafting Strategy in An Uncertain World, , Harvard Business Press; Courtney, H., Kirland, J., Viguerie, P., Strategy under uncertainty (1997) Harvard Business Review, NOV.-DEC, pp. 67-79; Drucker, P.F., (1980) Managing in Turbulent Times, , Haper and Row Publicher; Gausemeier, J., Fink, A., Schlake, O., Scenario management: An approach ti develop future potentials (1998) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 59, pp. 111-113; Godet, M., The art of scenarios and strategic planning: Tools and pitfalls (2000) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 65, pp. 3-22; Haeckel, S.H., (1999) Adaptive Enterprise: Creating and Leading Sense-and Respond Organizations, , HBS Press; Van Der Heijden, K., (1996) Scenarios: The Art of Strategic Conversation, , John Wiley & Sons; (2000) Virtual Mobile Services: Strategies for Fixed and Mobile Operator, , June 30; Schwartz, P., (1996) The Art of the Long View.

Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ont., Canada","This paper addresses the observation that foreign direct investment in a knowledge-intensive industry is motivated by the sourcing of knowledge and capabilities residing in the target firm. According to the emerging knowledge- and capability based view in international management, FDI is not only ""pushed"" by the resource endowments of the investor, but is also ""pulled"" towards centers of innovation located in recipient countries. For investors this bears the challenge to select those firms with the most valuable technological capabilities. Since most of these capabilities are tacit and not easily disentangled by outsiders, there is a strong incentive for target firms to signal the possession of these capabilities. We propose that ""high quality"" firms with unobservable or tacit capabilities send signals to the international marketplace about the value of their capabilities, reflecting their growth opportunities. © Gabler Verlag 2005.",,,"Akerlof, G.A., The market for lemons: Quality uncertainty and the market mechanism (1970) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 84, pp. 488-500; Alli, K.L., Thompson III, D.J., The wealth effects of private stock placements under regulation D (1993) The Financial Review, 28 (3), pp. 329-350; Almeida, P., Knowledge sourcing by foreign multinationals: Patent citation analysis in the U.S. semiconductor industry (1996) Strategic Management Journal, 17, pp. 155-165; Amburgey, T.L., Multivariate point processes in social research (1986) Social Science Research, 15, pp. 190-206; Anand, B.T., Khanna, T., Do firms learn how to create value?

Design/methodology/approach - A risk analysis method and baseline controls of BS7799 were used to generate security patterns of business convergence. With the analysis of existing enterprise architecture (EA) methods, the framework of the enterprise security architecture was designed. Findings - The adaptive framework, including the security patterns with quantitative factors, enterprise security architecture with 18 dimensions, and reference models in business convergence environments, is provided. Research limitations/implications - Information assets and baseline controls should be subdivided to provide more detailed risk factors and weight factors of each business convergence strategy. Case studies should be performed continuously to consolidate contents of best practices. Practical implications - With the enterprise security architecture provided in this paper, an enterprise that tries to create a value-added business model using convergence model can adapt itself to mitigate security risks and reduce potential losses.

This paper seeks to provide a framework for understanding the different types of uncertainties that can impact supply chains and their attendant information systems. Design/methodology/approach - Addresses the following questions. What are the different types of uncertainty at the general macro level? How are these macro level uncertainty types broken down into more specific types of uncertainty seen in supply chains? What impact do these uncertainties have on the supply chain and the supporting IS, and what are the current methods for dealing with them? Findings - The term uncertainty is used as a generic reference for various and sundry different types of problems within the management of supply chains and their supporting information systems (IS). This can lead to confusion about what tools and techniques are available and which tools apply to which types of problems. The framework presented allows researchers and practitioners to more accurately converse about the exact problems encountered in the management of supply chains and the tools that are needed to address these problems. Originality/value - The paper addresses uncertainty in supply chains and provides a starting-point for further discussion and research on the management of uncertainty within them. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Supply chain management;

T6G 2V4, Canada","Almost all existing work on the design of survivable networks is based on a specific demand forecast to which one optimizes routing and transport capacity assignment for a single target planning view. In practice these single-forecast models may be used repetitively by a planner to consider a range of different scenarios individually, hoping to develop intuition about how to proceed. But this is not the same as having a planning method that can inherently and quantitatively consider a range of possible futures all at once. Our approach considers both the cost of initial design construction and the expected cost of possible augmentations or ""recourse"" actions required in the future, adapting the network to accommodate different actual future demands. In practice, these recourse actions might include lighting up a new DWDM channel on an existing fiber or pulling-in additional cables, or leasing additional capacity from third party network operators, and so on. A stochastic linear programming approach is used to achieve designs for which the total cost of current outlays plus the expected future recourse costs is minimized. Realistic aspects of optical networking such as network survivability based on shared spare capacity and the modularity and economy-of-scale effects are considered. These are not only important practical details to reflect in planning, but they give the ""future-proof"" design problem for such networks some unique aspects. For instance, what is the working capacity under one future scenario that may not waste capacity if that demand scenario does not materialize, because the same channels may be used as shared spare capacity under other future scenarios. Similarly economy-of-scale effects bear uniquely on the future-proof planning problem, as the least-cost strategy on a life-cycle basis may actually be to place more capacity today than current requirements would suggest. This is of obvious relevance to planners given the recent hard times in the telecommunications industry, causing a tendency to minimize costs now regardless of the consequences. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Capacity planning;

A fire disturbance model linked to a harvest simulator was used to estimate the probability of harvest shortages under a range of harvest levels and fire suppression scenarios. Results were then used to estimate "" sustainable"" harvest levels based on a risk tolerance to harvest shortages and the effects of fire suppression. On a 288 000 ha forest in northeastern British Columbia, the cost of historical fire disturbance was estimated at $4 million per year in terms of foregone harvest profits. Suppressing 98.3% of disturbance events to 30% of their historical size had a value of $1.8 million per year. Higher levels of risk tolerance were associated with increased harvest levels and short-term profits, but as timber inventories were drawn down, average long-term profits became volatile. The modelling framework developed here can help to determine resilient forest management strategies and estimate the future flow and variability of harvest volumes, profits, and landscape conditions. © 2005 NRC.",,"Harvesting; Mathematical models; Probability; Timber; Fire disturbance model; Fire suppression; Harvest simulators; Harvest volumes; Forestry; disturbance; fire; forest management; harvesting; profitability; sustainable forestry; Forestry; Forests; Harvesting; Mathematical Models; Probability; British Columbia; Canada; North America; Western Hemisphere; World","Anderson, A., Nelson, J., Projecting vector based road networks with a shortest-path algorithm (2004) Can.

Traditional wisdom dictates the early selection of a single design in order to freeze interfaces between product subsystems so that team members can work effectively in parallel, resulting in more productive product development efforts. Prior research, however, uncovered a paradoxical case. Toyota Motor Corporation achieves the fastest development times in its industry by intentionally delaying alternative selection, a strategy termed set-based development. The current work adapts real options concepts to product development management to partially explain this paradox. A formal simulation model is used to show that converging too quickly or too slowly degrades project value. Furthermore, the model demonstrates that the wisdom of set-based strategies can be explained by the application of a real options approach to product development management. Implications for managers and directions for future work are discussed. © 2005 IEEE.","Product development; Project management; Real options; Set-based concurrent engineering; System dynamics","Computer simulation; Concurrent engineering; Cost effectiveness; Project management; Quality control; Real options; Set based concurrent engineering; System dynamics; Product development","Ford, D.N., Lander, D., Voyer, J., ""The real options approach to valuing strategic flexibility in uncertain construction projects"" (2001) Construction Manage.

The drivers of these uncertainties are also changing - strategic risk which generally has a low probability of occurrence, but large consequences has begun to replace tactical risk. Managing these risks requires not only new assessment tools such as scorecarding and mapping, but also more systematic decision frameworks.

We present a robustness test for these projections that measure the possible level of deviation between projection and implementation while still meeting projected target levels. Results using both simulation and optimization models indicate that when using a maximum sustainable volume objective, the projections have very little robustness. Reducing the target volume increases robustness, but with a large cost to the sustainable timber harvest level. Matching the level of uncertainty in the planning environment with corresponding level of robustness in projections is an important factor in creating sustainable forest management plans. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Plcy., Newport, RI, United States","Although security - as a basic concept - is frequently considered in the study and analysis of policy decisions, its essential meaning ought to be more widely disagreed than agreed upon. Commonly considered a basic concept in policy and academic debates, security is in reality a quantity that is not basic at any register. The couching of emerging 'non-traditional' concepts such as environmental security and human security solely on their relationship to potential or real threats, most often within a topology of power, and the use of language that is inadequate to the often nuanced and almost always complex dynamics of such emerging identities imprisons such concepts within 'traditional' state-centered, national security paradigms. Moreover, not all security issues involve 'threats'; rather, the notion of vulnerabilities is as serious to some peoples, and some regions, as the more familiar concept of threat. The issue truly is not one of 'hard' traditional security (often based on state-to-state power relationships) or 'soft' non-traditional security (which can involve multiple transnational aspects), but rather the need for a focus on both. Too exclusive a focus on one form of security may cause a 'boomerang effect', resulting from failure to recognize, or deal with, other contending forms of security. Recognizing and acting on the best approaches to issues of security will prove the greatest challenge. © 2005 PRIO.","Policy implications; Security as concept; Threats; Vulnerabilities",,"Ash, T.G., 'Europe's Endangered Liberal Order' (1998) Foreign Affairs, 77 (2), pp. 51-66; Barbour, I., (1993) Ethics in an Age of Technology: The Gifford Lectures, 2, pp. 1990-1991. , San Francisco, CA: Harper; Barnett, T.P.M., 'The Pentagon's New Map: Why We're Going to War and Why We'll Keep Going to War' (2003) Esquire, 139, pp. 174-181. , (March); Barnett, T.P.M., (2004) The Pentagon's New Map: War and Peace in the Twenty-First Century, , New York: G.

Agent-based systems have been a popular field of study in computer science for some time. While computer science-related research has been focused on the artifact itself, such as computational languages and algorithms, research in the management sciences is explicitly focused on business problems. Research in Information Systems (IS) has begun to advance knowledge in the use of agent-based systems as a means to seek different, computational explanations for business phenomena that have eluded scientific inquiry reliant on traditional'specifically, law and axiomatic'explanation (Kimbrough, 2003). The focus on business problems requires a different research approach than what is successful in computer science. Key modifications include first, the explicit articulation of benefits specific to the management sciences, and second, instrument validation. © 2005, IGI Global.

In this study, 15 failure cases in the Korean telecommunications service industry were analyzed. From the analysis, eight factors leading to telecommunications service failure were found. The characteristics of eight failure factors were analyzed depending on the phases of the NPD process and the types of the services. The characterization of the failure factors provided important managerial implications for the efficient service development process. In the ever-changing business environment, simply following previous success factors never allows for the duplication of success. Learning from the failure case analysis provides important insight for the development of new telecommunications services. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The current turbulence on markets, politics and technology is generating many uncertainties with regard to, for instance, user needs, dominant technology and the role of different market players. The goal of this paper is to show how to apply the scenario method for coping with these uncertainties in the development of mobile data services. We argue that mobile service providers should pay more and permanent attention to these uncertainties when developing new mobile data services. In 2001 a Dutch consortium (named MOBUS), consisting of representatives of mobile service providers, research institutes, universities, telecommunication suppliers and financial companies, undertook a project with the goal of defining possible new services for the mobile telecommunications industry. To develop a view on the future, a set of four scenarios for the year 2005 was developed. These scenarios were not only made to gain insight into possible new mobile data services but also into how users might use these services and which technologies might be available. An important element of the project was a list of uncertainties produced by the consortium that formed the basis of the scenarios. These uncertainties were evaluated two years later to find out whether these uncertainties are still valid, why they changed and if new uncertainties have come up. Two items were considered to be not uncertain anymore, i.e. mobile services will be multimedia based and mobile payment is available. On the other hand 26 new uncertainties were identified. Therefor all market parties involved in mobile data services development should reconsider uncertainties on a regular basis with different teams of experts.",,"Decision making; Ground penetrating radar systems; Investments; Local area networks; Multimedia systems; Telecommunication industry; Telecommunication services; Mobile data service market; Mobile payment; Mobile services; Mobile telecommunication industry; Mobile telecommunication systems","Van Asselt, M.B.A., Langendonck, R., Van Asten, F., Van Der Giessen, A., Janssen, P.H.M., Heuberger, P.S.C., Geuskens, I., (2001) Uncertainty & RIVM's Environmental Outlooks.

It is universally accepted that software must be continually changed to remain satisfactory in use and evolution is often seen as the long term result of software maintenance. In this paper I argue that replacement, in addition to change, be considered as a basic mechanism for software evolution. In other words, the traditional approach to evolving a software system by changing its components should be contrasted with the alternative of replacing the individual components. This entails a shift of perspective from the current situation, where a need for a new/modified characteristics of a system raised by the business entails a change request to the system's supplier, to the situation in which the same need entails disengaging the affected system's components and searching the marketplace for replacement components that meet the new needs. The paper discusses motivations for such a change of perspective and shows how service oriented architectures can support it.",,"Computer architecture; Computer software maintenance; Industrial management; Iterative methods; Mathematical models; Quality of service; Societies and institutions; World Wide Web; Business models; Replacement components; Service oriented architectures; Technology innovation; Software engineering","Aversano, L., Canfora, G., Ciampi, A., An algorithm for web Service discovery through their composition (2004) Proc. of International Conference on Web Services, , [ACC04], San Diego, CA, IEEE Comp.

As uncertainty increases and forecasting becomes difficult, the value of financial modeling techniques decreases. Borrowing from the strategic management literature, we argue that it may be useful to employ a qualitative approach to evaluate capital projects when faced with high levels of uncertainty. In order to illustrate our argument, we use a derivative of scenario planning and qualitative real options to evaluate non-quantifiable factors in a project for the National Ignition Facility. © 2004 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.

A semiconductor design licensor that introduces products in a range of environments was studied: in some environments the subcomponent architectures of competitor products differ widely, while in others all competitor products have the same subcomponents. The approach adopted involved multiple detailed interviews covering the full range of participants in the product development processes from designers through project managers to directors. Reporting from these multiple informants was captured using a novel mapping approach that allowed participants to develop interactively their understanding of informal as well as formal processes at work within the company. It was found that the degree of architectural uncertainty is a major determinant of feasible organization structures for product introduction. It was also found that 'microproduct' architecture offers considerable freedom in the opportunities for dispersion of project activities. The degree of formality and structure in design technologies and their link to highly characterized production processes was identified as a key factor of this industry sector. The implications of these findings include the probability that (a) where design technologies can simulate product performance, dispersed teams with high priority can resolve architectural uncertainties; (b) a cross-functional team may not resolve architectural uncertainty as well as autonomous teams focused on subproducts (microproducts); (c) early entrants may benefit by allowing business units to adopt diverse approaches to product introduction, since architectural uncertainty may vary between products at different stages of their lives. This suggests that small high-technology companies may find it easier to expand into new geographies and product lines than was previously believed. Further work is necessary to make more confident statements about the linkage between product environment and team organization, but the ideas of architectural uncertainty and microproduct team organization may be of immediate interest to companies of all sizes when seeking to select appropriate product introduction processes and organization. © IMechE 2004.","Dispersed environments; Global product teams; Multiple detailed interviews; New Product Development; Product development processes; Product introduction; Semiconductor manufacturing; Software Development; Uncertainty","Computer simulation; Mapping; Probability; Product development; Semiconductor materials; Software engineering; Dispersed environments; Global product teams; Multiple detailed interviews; New product development; Product development processes; Product introductions; Semiconductor manufacturing; Uncertainty; Product design","Cooper, The invisible success factors in product innovation (1999) J.

Drawing on research in entrepreneurship, real options, and strategic management under uncertainty, we demonstrate how corporations affected by government policy can use entrepreneurial strategies to exploit discontinuities generated by uncertain and unstable public policy environments. We argue that specific strategies will be effective depending on the degree and slope/inflection profile of policy change. Four strategies are identified: preemptive, optioned, synchronized, and adaptive. We develop propositions and provide illustrations to show how each of these strategies has helped firms respond to transitional policy environments. We conclude by offering a discussion of the utility and limitations of the framework and its potential application to other managerial circumstances in which uncertainty is pervasive, and by describing opportunities for further research, including empirical testing of our model.",,,"Ahuja, G., Lampert, C.M., Entrepreneurship in the large corporation: A longitudinal study of how established firms create breakthrough inventions (1999) Strategic Management Journal, 22, pp. 521-543; Axelrod, A., Cohen, M.D., (2000) Harnessing Complexity: Organizational Implications of a Scientific Frontier, , New York: Free Press; Barney, J., Organization culture: Can it be a source of sustained competitive advantage?

This study investigates the impact of environmental uncertainty and task characteristics on user satisfaction with data by using IS and organizational theories. Responses were matched from 77 CEOs and 166 senior managers, who were end users of IS. The partial least squares technique indicated that environmental uncertainty has a positive impact on task characteristics. Task characteristics have a direct and mediating impact on user satisfaction with data. Our findings also demonstrated that user satisfaction with data could be better understood by overlapping IS and organizational theories, rather than by treating the subject matter in disjoint fields. The paper concludes with discussions and implications for researchers and practitioners.","Environmental uncertainty; Task characteristics; Task technology fit; User satisfaction","Environmental uncertainities; Task characteristics; Task technology fit; User satisfaction; Competition; Decision making; Error analysis; Information technology; Life cycle; Marketing; Probability; Product design; Societies and institutions; Technological forecasting; User interfaces; Data reduction","Aguinis, H., Beaty, J.C., Boik, R.J., Pierce, C.A., Effect size and power in moderating effects of categorical variables using multiple regression: A 30-year review (2004) J.

However, uncertainty in the business environment has still been the main cause of failure in industry. The paper investigates the role of postponement in the management of uncertainty. The concept of postponement is developed to include product development postponement, purchasing postponement, production postponement and logistics postponement. These postponement strategies are all presented to cope with different levels of uncertainty. Finally, conclusions are drawn and some remarks about further research are made.",,"Competitive intelligence; Information analysis; Inventory control; Product design; Product development; Production engineering; Societies and institutions; Strategic planning; Supply chain management; Taxonomy; Risk management","Alderson, W., Marketing efficiency and the principle of postponement (1950) Cost and Profit Outlook, 3, pp. 15-18; Aldrich, H.E., (1979) Organizations and Environments Process, , Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall; Service please (2000) Business Week, 23 OCTOBER; Baldwin, C.Y., Clark, K.B., Managing in an age modularity (1997) Harvard Business Review, 75, pp. 84-93; Battezzati, L., Magnani, R., Supply chains for FMCG and industrial products in Italy Practices and the advantages of postponement (2000) International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, 30, pp. 413-424; Berry, D., Towill, D.R., Material flow in electronic product-based supply chains (1992) International Journal of Logistics Management, 3, pp. 77-94; Bowersox, D.J., Closs, D.J., (1996) Logistical Management: The Integrated Supply Chains Process, , New York: McGraw-Hill; Bowersox, D.J., Stand, T.P., Daugherty, P.J., Lean launch: Managing product introduction risk through response-based logistics (1999) Journal of Production Innovative Management, 16, pp. 557-568; Brown, A.O., Lee, H.L., Petrakian, R., Xilinx improves its semiconductor supply chain using product and process postponement (2000) Interfaces, 30, pp. 65-80; Brown, S.L., Eisenhardt, K.M., Product development: Past research, present findings, and future directions (1995) Academy of Management Review, 20, pp. 343-378; Bucklin, L.P., Postponement, speculation and the structure of distribution channels (1965) Journal of Marketing Research, 2, pp. 26-31; Burns, T., Stalker, G.M., (1961) The Management of Innovation, , London: Tavistock; Childerhouse, P., Aitken, J., Towill, D.R., Analysis and design of focused demand chains (2002) Journal of Operations Management, 20, pp. 675-689; Childerhouse, P., Towill, D.R., Analysis of the factors affecting real-world value stream performance (2002) International Journal of Production Research, 40, pp. 3499-3518; Chiou, J., Wu, L., Hsu, J.C., The adoption of form postponement strategy in a global logistics system: The case of Taiwanese information technology industry (2002) Journal of Business Logistics, 23, pp. 107-124; Christopher, M., (1998) Logistics and Supply Chain Management, , London: Financial Times Pitman; Christopher, M., The agile supply chain: Competing in volatile markets (2000) Industrial Marketing Management, 29, pp. 37-44; Christopher, M., Towill, D., An integrated model for the design of agile supply chains (2001) International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, 31, pp. 235-246; Christopher, M., Towill, D.R., Developing market specific supply chain strategies (2002) International Journal of Logistics Management, 13, pp. 1-14; Clarke, M.P., Virtual logistics: An introduction and overview of the concepts (1998) International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, 28, pp. 486-507; Cooper, R.G., Stage-gate system: A new tool for managing new products (1990) Business Horizons, 33, pp. 44-54; Corey, E.R., (1978) The Organizational Context of Industrial Buying Behaviour, , Cambridge, MA: Marketing Science Institute; Courtney, H., Kirkland, J., Viguerie, P., Strategy under uncertainty (1997) Harvard Business Review, 75, pp. 67-79; Cox, A., Power, value and supply chain management (1999) Supply Chain Management: An International Journal, 4, pp. 167-175; Daft, R., (2000) Organisation Theory and Design, , Cincinnati, OH: South-Western College Publishing; Davis, S., (1987) Future Perfect, , Reading, MA: Addison Wesley; Davis, T., Effective supply chain management (1993) Shan Management Review, 34, pp. 35-46; De Meyer, A., Nakane, J., Miller, J., Ferdows, K., Flexibility: The next competitive battle (1989) Strategic Management Journal, 10, pp. 135-144; Downey, H.K., Slocum, J.W., Uncertainty: Measures, research and sources of variation (1975) Academy of Management Journal, 18, pp. 562-578; Duncan, R.B., Characteristics of organizational environments and perceived environmental uncertainty (1972) Administrative Science Quarterly, 17, pp. 313-327; Feitzinger, E., Lee, H.L., Mass customization at Hewlett-Packard: The power of postponement (1997) Harvard Business Review, 75, pp. 116-121; Fisher, M.L., What is the right supply chain for your product?

Given the inherent limitations of intuition and heuristics, one might expect decision-makers to be delighted with the more consistent approach provided by rational decision-making techniques. Modern decision models can help process large amounts of information without losing valuable pieces. They never suffer from distraction, fatigue, boredom or random error. They are consistent, week after week.Yet, in spite of these obvious advantages, people treat these with a nearly instinctive distaste. They are particularly resistant to the idea that simple models can validly make such subjective evaluations. For some, that resistance may stem simply from unfamiliarity with the statistics and probability involved. Many more, however, subscribe to the widespread assumption that human judgment is more discerning than a model. They are reluctant to believe that simple mathematical calculations can match the complexity of the human mind. ""Take away an ordinary person's illusions,"" says Dr. Relling in Henrik Ibsen's Villanden, ""and you take away happiness at the same time.""A particularly interesting aspect of human judgment and decision-making are the traps we unknowingly step into. Many decision-makers believe that intuition, repeated experience and their general intelligence will see them through. Unfortunately, as will be discussed in the paper, intuition and repetition are unreliable teachers at best.",,"Cognitive systems; Computer simulation; Decision making; Monte Carlo methods; Decision trees; Petroleum engineering","Grayson, C.J., (1960) Decisions under Uncertainty: Drilling Decisions by Oil and Gas Operators, , Division of Research, Harvard Business School, Cambridge, MA; Campbell J.M., Jr., Campbell J.M., Sr., Campbell, R.A., (2001) Analyzing and Managing Risky Investments, , John M.

This illuminating book cuts through these conflicting issues to show how organizational communication plays a vital role in confronting uncertainty. Arguing that many managers fail to adequately consider the communication consequences of the decision making process and its impact on organizational effectiveness, Hargie and Tourish present here numerous organizational communication insights, and show how they reveal a way through these dilemmas. Based on cutting-edge research findings and case studies, this book features contributions from the UK, USA, Canada, New Zealand and Norway, bringing multiple perspectives to this topical subject. The result is a comprehensive guide to organizational communication useful for managers, academics and students. © 2004 Selection and editorial matter, Dennis Tourish and Owen Hargie.

Employees and other intangible resources (i.e. intellectual capital) generally represent the most critical resources in the value creation process. Crafting strategy in such contexts is not helped by conventional models and tools of strategy. The assumptions which underpin many of them do not hold in the present competitive environment, making them at best irrelevant, but at worst leading to the development of strategies that can put the success of a company in jeopardy. New metaphors for describing these companies and their competitive realities, as well as tools for navigating in them, are required, if the strategy discipline is to remain relevant for practitioners. In this paper, it is suggested that the intellectual capital perspective can provide a bridge to the practical application of a vision- and values-based strategy through the notion of embodying strategy in organizational resources. A conceptualization of strategy, that links strategy, identity and intellectual capital, more suitable to knowledge-intensive companies competing in uncertain environments, is introduced and described. © 2003, MCB UP Limited","Corporate identity; Corporate strategy; Intellectual capital; Knowledge organizations",,"Albert, S., Whetten, D., Organizational identity (1985) Research in Organizational Behavior, 7. , in Cummings, L.L. and Staw, B.M.

The possession of complementary innovation-producing resources by small and large firms helps explain patterns of interaction among firms in dynamic, technology-based industries.

However, computer technology has made both quantitative data more abundant and optimization more feasible. At the same time, modelers are encountering real situations and clients with high-stakes questions that are nearly impossible to answer without optimization-the systems involved are not only dynamic, and not only highy interconnected, but also combinatorially daunting. In particular, corporate marketers currently make allocation decisions impacting billions of dollars of shareholder value on the basis of intuitive ""anchor and adjust"" strategies, which can be far from optimal. This article presents an anonymized case study of one such situation. The company is in a high-tech industry undergoing rapid change. The company needed to fashion a go-to-market strategy balancing traditional and unfamiliar markets, an important component of which was allocation of marketing resources. Optimization revealed a potential valuation increase of roughly 30 per cent relative to executives' intuitive allocations. Scenario analysis revealed the basic policy direction (more advertising) to be robust, and in the process resolved several traditional conundrums in dealing with adverse events in the marketplace. © 2003 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.",,"optimization; systems analysis","Ariza, C.A., Graham, A.K., Quick and rigorous, strategic and participative: 12 ways to improve the expected tradeoffs (2002) Proceedings of the 2002 International System Dynamics Conference, , http://www.albany.edu/cpr/sds/, Palermo, Italy.

As a result, several critical reviews and meta-analyses have been reported which highlight notable limitations in extant studies. In addressing certain of these, this study presents an empirical investigation of medium and large, high technology, industrial manufacturing firms. Business strategy is conceptualized as a comparative construct with six dimensions and an attempt is made to relate these characteristics of strategic orientation with firms' business performance. The results indicate that firms' emphasis upon analysis, defensiveness, and futurity in strategic orientation are related to business performance. Discussion is given to these findings and implications are drawn for business executives and future research. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

Ninety-two of the 450 top executives of the largest industrial companies in Israel, representing various business sectors, responded to the research questionnaire. Contrary to the research hypothesis, it was found that risk strategy in an organization is not uniform but varies across activities. In-depth interviews with 21 of the participants supported the findings, suggesting that propensity to risk taking is generally high in activities that support organizational core competencies and competitive advantage, whereas in other activities it depends on the organization's being risk seeking or risk averse. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Merging of companies can increase the complexity of system integration, with the need to integrate applications like Enterprise Resource Planning and Customer Relationship Management. Even if sometimes these applications provide a kind of access to their underlying data and business logic, Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) is still a challenge. In this paper we analyse the needs that drive EAI with the aim of identifying the features that EAI platforms must exhibit to enable companies to compete in the new business scenarios. We discuss the limitations of current EAI platforms and their evaluation methods, mainly economies of scale and economies of scope, and argue that a shift is needed towards the economies of learning model. Finally, we outline an EAI architecture that addresses current limitations enabling economies of learning.","Enterprise application integration; IT evaluation models; IT strategies; Legacy system integration","Digital storage;

There have been numerous studies and publications discussing methods and models for rational decision-making. Given the inherent limitations of intuition and heuristics, one might expect decision-makers to be delighted with the more consistent approach provided by rational decision-making techniques. Modern decision models can help process large amounts of information without losing valuable pieces. They never suffer from distraction, fatigue, boredom or random error. They are consistent, week after week. Yet, in spite of these obvious advantages, people treat these with a nearly instinctive distaste. They are particularly resistant to the idea that simple models can validly make such subjective evaluations. For some, that resistance may stem simply from unfamiliarity with the statistics and probability involved. Many more, however, subscribe to the widespread assumption that human judgment is more discerning than a model. They are reluctant to believe that simple mathematical calculations can match the complexity of the human mind. ""Take away an ordinary person's illusions,"" says Dr. Relling in Henrik Ibsen's Villanden, ""and you take away happiness at the same time."" A particularly interesting aspect of human judgment and decision-making are the traps we unknowingly step into. Many decision-makers believe that intuition, repeated experience and their general intelligence will see them through. Unfortunately, as will be discussed in the paper, intuition and repetition are unreliable teachers at best.",,"Decision models; Cognitive systems; Crude petroleum; Decision making; Gas industry; Probability; Project management; Random processes; Statistical methods; Petroleum industry","Grayson, C.J., (1960) Decisions under Uncertainty: Drilling Decisions by Oil and Gas Operators, , Division of Research, Harvard Business School, Cambridge, MA; Campbell Jr., J.M., Campbell Sr., J.M., Campbell, R.A., (2001) Analyzing and Managing Risky Investments, , John M.

Among all, Sun Tzu's The Art of War has been widely adopted and applied in various business areas. However, there are few presentations with strategic models. Moreover, works on his successor, Sun Pin, are limited particularly to the area of applying his art of warfare in gaining strategic advantages and transforming business crisis into opportunities. While various business and quality management models at national level have been established by various countries to emphasise their differences in economic development and culture, models of similar type that make use of the ancient Chinese wisdom are not available either in Hong Kong or in China. As China has become a member of the WTO, a national model that framed both the Chinese management philosophy and Western management wisdom would certainly help in driving local and international enterprises for business competitiveness. This paper is therefore a first attempt to investigate the applicability of Sun Pin's The Art of Warfare for business management strategies by amalgamating the Western wisdom and the Chinese art of warfare.","Baldrige Award; China; Literature; Quality","Competitive intelligence; Customer satisfaction; Information analysis; Strategic planning; Total quality management; Management strategies; Management science","Bohoris, G.A., A comparative assessment of some major quality awards (1995) International Journal of Quality & Reliability Management, 12 (9), pp. 30-43; Courtney, H., Kirkland, J., Viguerie, P., Strategy under uncertainty (1998) Harvard Business Review, 75 (6), pp. 66-79; Crowell, D.P., (2000) Performance One: An Interpretive Guide to the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award Criteria for Performance Excellence, , WorldSource One, Inc., Las Vegas, NV; Flynn, B.B., Saladin, B., Further evidence on the validity of the theoretical models underlying the Baldrige criteria (2001) Journal of Operations Management, 19, pp. 617-652; Frigo, M.L., Litman, J., What is strategic management?

In the 21st century, it is likely that radiology will continue to grow by interfacing with new and important domains such as information technology and molecular biology and by playing a more central role in general medical education, biomedical research, and noninvasive therapeutic interventions. To sustain such wide-ranging growth and yet remain intact as a medical specialty, the profession will require many radiologists who can provide leadership to bridge the many gaps between the various frontiers and the traditional core of radiology. These radiologists will need skills and background in two critical management areas: Leadership and strategy. This article approaches the broad topic of strategy in several ways. First, it provides the radiologist with a basic framework for strategy development. Second, it summarizes central ideas from the evolving field of strategic thinking. Finally, it outlines a strategy-based method for dealing with uncertainty about the future and identifies situations where specific strategic tools and techniques are likely to be helpful. © RSNA, 2002.","Radiology and radiologists, socioeconomic issues; Review","clinical medicine; clinical practice; information science; leadership; management; medical education; medical research; molecular biology; priority journal; radiologist; radiology; review; technology; thinking; Forecasting; Models, Theoretical; Radiology","Fuchs, V.R., Sox H.C., Jr., Physicians' views of the relative importance of thirty medical innovations (2001) Health Aff (Millwood), 20, pp. 30-42; New pathways for educating radiologists for the future (2000) RSNA Research & Education Foundation Consensus Conference, , www.rsna.org/research/foundation/consensus_conf2000.pdf, Oak Brook, III: Radiological Society of North America; Chan, S., Alternative educational pathways: Their future role in changing the mental models of academic radiology (1999) Acad Radiol, 6, pp. 547-551; Alderson, P.O., Customer service and satisfaction in radiology (2000) AJR Am J Roentgenol, 175, pp. 319-323; Gunderman, R.B., Leadership in radiology (1999) Acad Radiol, 6, pp. 444-451; Gunderman, R.B., Take me to your (future) leader (2001) Acad Radiol, 8, pp. 762-767; Schomer, D.F., Schomer, B.G., Chang, P.J., Value innovation in the radiology practice (2001) RadioGraphics, 21, pp. 1019-1024; Neiman, H.L., Disruptive technologies (2001) ACR Bull, 57, p. 3; Christensen, C.M., Bower, J.L., Kenagy, J., Will disruptive innovations cure health care?

Traditional “bricks and mortar” businesses are facing the prospects of losing their competitive advantage owing to the emergence of new competitors in the “new economy”. The regulatory changes in the financial services industry and the explosion in the use of the Internet for ecommerce have given rise to unforeseen competitors in the banking industry – the “nonbank” financial services providers and the “pure” Internet banks. These competitors are not restrained by the high costs of the branch infrastructure and as a result are able to differentiate on the basis of offering high interest rates. These players are fast and flexible. In spite of being newcomers, they have the potential to grow and recast the rules of the banking industry. Yet, incumbent banks still have the strongest sustainable competitive advantage: their corporate identity. Managers in the “new and old economy” must realise that corporate identity is an important strategic element that should be considered in the need to differentiate. © 2002, MCB UP Limited","Corporate communications; Corporate identity; Ecommerce; Financial services",,"Balmer, J.M.T., Soenen, G.B., Rethinking the corporate identity mix (1998) ICCIS Working Paper, , University of Strathclyde, Glasgow; Balmer, J.M.T., Soenen, G.B., The acid test of corporate identity management (1999) Journal of Marketing Management, 15, pp. 69-79; Brandenburger, A., Nalebuff, B.J., (1996) Co-opetition, , Harper Collins Publishers, London; Courtney, H., Kirkland, J., Viguerie, P., Strategy under uncertainty (1997) Harvard Business Review, pp. 43-53. , November-December, reprint 97603; Dayal, S., Zandesburg, H., Zeisser, M., Building digital brands (2000) McKinsey Quarterly, (2), pp. 42-51; Evans, P.B., Wurster, T.S., Strategy and the new economics of information (1997) Harvard Business Review, pp. 34-41. , September-October; Hagel, J., Hewlin, T., Hutchings, T., Retail banking: caught in a Web?

With a global market volume exceeding US$40 billion, music is not only one of the primary entertainment goods in its own right. Since music is easily personalized and transmitted, it also permeates many other services across cultural borders, anticipating social and economic trends. This article presents one of the first detailed empirical studies on the impact of internet technologies on a specific industry. Drawing on more than 100 interviews conducted between 1996 and 2000 with multinational and independent music companies in 10 markets, strategies of the major players, current business models, future scenarios and regulatory responses to the online distribution of music files are identified and evaluated. The data suggest that changes in the music industry will indeed be far-reaching, but disintermediation is not the likely outcome.","Copyright; Disintermediation; Electronic market hypothesis; Information society; MP3; Music industry; Piracy; Publisher; Record company; Risk finance; Scenario analysis",,"Arthur, W.B., (1994) Increasing Returns and Path Dependence in the Economy, , Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press; Arthur, W.B., Increasing Returns and the New World of Business (1996) Harvard Business Review, (JULY-AUGUST), pp. 100-109; Arrow, K., The Economic Implications of Learning by Doing (1962) Review of Economic Studies, 29, pp. 155-173; Barlow, J.P., The Economy of Ideas (1994) Wired, 2 (3), p. 84; Barlow, J.P., The Next Economy of Ideas (2000) Wired, 8 (10), pp. 238-252; Boden, M., Kastrinos, N., Miles, I., The Management of Intellectual Property in Knowledge-Intensive Business Firms (1998) ESRC Report L3024, , ESRC: Swindon; Caves, R.E., (2000) Creative Industries: Contracts between Arts and Commerce, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Chell, E., Critical Incident Technique (1998) Qualitative Methods and Analysis in Organizational Research, pp. 51-72. , G.

The need to do so is increasingly frequent, and companies must increasingly face up to the reality of a continuous cycle of strategy-making. Traditionally strategy-making has leaned towards either a disciplined approach, or one that embraces and utilises imagination. Each of these approaches contains strengths and weaknesses: discipline. e.g., an analytical planning approach, rarely generates original insight; imagination, e.g., experimentation, may give vent to innovative thinking, but it can lead to chaos and to losing touch with reality. The authors of this paper argue that companies would be better served by striving to balance discipline and imagination. In this way, for example, the creative foresight of innovators is combined with realistic analysis. The authors illustrate these ideas with a variety of cases of companies that have effectively combined imagination and discipline when forming their strategy. In the case of Walt Disney, a think-tank of 'Imagineers' for the company's theme park attractions brings together a wide variety of specialists whose expertise is grounded in either imagination or discipline. Peco, a US electricity provider, has also embraced the combination of discipline and imagination for its strategy-making, but in this case through its Project Leapfrog, imagination and discipline were each stressed at different times. The authors conclude by pointing out that strategy-making in fast moving environments is an art that is learned by doing and requires the capacity to intervene on the strategy-making process to achieve and preserve a delicate balance between discipline and imagination.",,"Electricity; Industry; Shifting landscape; Planning; corporate strategy; learning; strategic approach","Hamel, G., Strategy as revolution (1996) Harvard Business Review, 74 (4), pp. 69-82; Mintzberg, H., Ahlstrand, B.W., Lampel, J., (1998) Strategy Safari: A Guided Tour Through the Wilds of Strategic Management, , Free Press, New York; Steiner, G.A., (1979) Strategic Planning: What Every Manager Must Know, , Free Press, New York; Byrne, J.A., Strategic planning is back (1996) Business Week, pp. 46-52; Hamel, G., Prahalad, C.K., Competing for the future (1994) Harvard Business Review, 72 (4), pp. 122-128; Bowman, E.H., Next steps for corporate strategy (1995) Advances in Strategic Management, pp. 39-64. , JAI Press; March, J., The evolution of evolution (1994) Evolutionary Dynamics of Organizations, , J.

The increasing complexity of technologies in addition to shorter product life cycles are also forcing firms to rely on R & D as a source of strategy. More importantly, firms are inclined to evaluate their technologies from a portfolio's perspective in which a set or a sub-set of R & D projects is evaluated together, in relation to each other. Portfolio techniques can help strategic managers in evaluating whether a portfolio of products is adequate from the perspective of long-term corporate growth and profitability. Obviously, when R & D projects are evaluated relative to one another, technical capability management of such projects must be carried out concurrently. In this paper, R & D Project Portfolio Matrix is used as a tool for analyzing a portfolio of R & D projects by linking competitive advantages of a firm to benefits these projects may provide to customers. Examples of batteries for electric vehicles (EV) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) are provided to illustrate how such a matrix is used, and some of the implications for innovation management of such projects. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.","Automotive industry; Competitive advantage; Innovation; Portfolio management; R & D","Competition; Research and development management; Technology transfer; Innovation management; Project management","Abell, D.F., Hammond, J.S., (1979) Strategic Market Planning: Problems and Analytical Approaches, , Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ; Abernathy, W.J., Clark, K.B., Innovation: Mapping the winds of creative destruction (1985) Readings in the Management of Innovation, pp. 55-78. , Tushman, M., Moore, W.L.

How do business schools teach managers to think this way? The premise of this article is that in their strategizing, senior marketing executives, boards of directors, consultants, and financial analysts should see the market and the firm's embeddedness in a market as a moving video rather than a static snapshot. The authors propose that what makes the video move are fundamental feedback effects that create the evolutionary paths that a market and a firm may travel. A taxonomy of systemic feedback regularities is presented with applications that demonstrate how the taxonomy and proposed soft mapping techniques can be used to construct dynamic mental models that help managers and consultants improve their dynamic strategic thinking and the strategic foresight of firms.

C., Australia, Intl. Advsy. Bd. APEC Technol. F., Bangkok, Thailand","The use of foresight as a tool in national research and technology planning exercises has increased markedly over the past decade, as a consequence of the pressures of the emerging knowledge economy, constraints on government spending, the new emphasis in organizations on learning, networks and relationships, and changes in the structures of knowledge production. It is therefore timely to invest in evaluation of and learning from these experiences. That the business management focus in addressing the future is far more on issues of structure and culture, such as flexibility, adaptability and tolerance for ambiguity, than it is on tools such as foresight, suggests the need for a much closer linking of foresight to other company considerations. Three particular areas of challenge are identified. The first is linking foresight more effectively with strategy and action, through better engagement of and with key stakeholders. The second is the development and refinement of the range of foresight techniques with a clear appreciation of their appropriate arena of application. The third is to acknowledge the cultural dimension of foresight, and to apply it with an awareness of the potential cultural constraints. An alternative framework for foresight, modelled on 'participatory policy analysis', is proposed to improve the interface of foresight with political and administrative decision making process.","Delphi; Foresight; Innovation; Participatory policy analysis; Scenario planning","Scenario planning; Management; Planning; Public policy; Technological forecasting","(1996) Special Issue on Government Technology Foresight Exercises, (17), p. 23. , OECD, Paris; Martin, B.R., Technology foresight: Capturing the benefits from science-related technologies (1996) Research Evaluation, 6 (2), pp. 158-168; (1998) Technology Foresight, , NSTDA, Thailand; Shin, T., Application of technology foresight to the formulation of S&T policies (1998) Application of Technology Foresight, pp. 59-80. , NSTDA, Bangkok; Martin, B.R., Johnston, R., Technology foresight for wiring up the national innovation system: Experiences in Britain, Australia and New Zealand (1999) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 60, pp. 37-54; Gibbons, M., (1994) The New Production of Knowledge: The Dynamics of Science and Research in Contemporary Societies, , Sage, London; (1996) Foresighling Around the World: A Review of Seven Best-in-Kind Programs, , Seattle; Martin, B.R., Irvine, J., (1989) Research Foresight, , Pinter, London; Johnston, R., Foresight: A new approach to strategic planning, a management tool, or a new social contract for research - Australian and international experience (1998) Institute for the Prospective Technological Studies, , Seville, Spain; Hesselbein, F., Goldsmith, M., Beckhard, R., (1996) The Leader of the Future, , Jossey Bass, San Francisco; Wack, P., Scenarios: Uncharted waters ahead (1985) Harvard Business Review, , Cambridge, September-October; Wack, P., Scenarios: Shooting the rapids (1985) Harvard Business Review, , Cambridge, November-December; Price, G., Managing uncertainty and risk using scenarios (1997) Managing Technology for Competitive Advantage, pp. 305-326. , J.

Several approaches have been proposed as possible strategies for dealing with these uncertainties. The implications of adopting a hedging strategy are investigated in an industry where a dominant design has yet to emerge. Using the personal computer (PC) industry as a case study, this research shows that (1) firms are most likely to hedge prior to the emergence of a dominant design, (2) hedging is related to increased survival rates, and (3) hedging is related to higher market share. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

Recent profound changes in its economy, including the NAFTA agreement, led us to conclude that Mexico provided a natural test setting in which to assess managers' perceptions of environmental uncertainty and their strategic and organizational responses to it. Forty-five Mexican managers with responsibility for the strategic direction of their firms were interviewed in Monterrey, Guadalajara, and Mexico City. Results indicated that Mexican managers responded to environmental turbulence by adapting planning processes, competitive strategies, organization structure, and managerial process; these changes generally conformed to predictions in the uncertainty and contingency literatures regarding adaptation to uncertain environments. Although the majority of firms interviewed reported making significant changes to their organizational structures, implementation lagged both reported structural adaptation and that of strategic change. In fact, there was significant retention of the functional mindset, even when environmental and strategic conditions called for more decentralized arrangements. This contradiction creates an opportunity for partnership. Combining foreign firms' knowledge of the reengineering process with the local partner's business and political relationships creates a synergy that may justify foreign expansion into Mexico. © 2000 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","environmental uncertainty; Mexico; strategic and organizational adaptation",,"Aldrich, H.E., (1979) Organizations and Environments, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ, Englewood Cliffs, NJ,: Prentice-Hall; Austin, J.E., (1990) Managing in Developing Countries, , New York, New York,: Free Press; Bannister, G.J., The Economic Context of the Mexican Crisis (1998) Latin American Business Review, 1, pp. 23-50; Bartlett, C.A., Ghoshal, S., (1992) Transnational Management Text, Cases, and Readings in Cross-Border Management, , Homewood, IL, Homewood, IL,: Richard D.

In this article, research and commentaries from the strategic management and international marketing planning literatures are brought together in a model examining what factors influence global strategic marketing planning formality, and whether competitive and organizational benefits accrue from the process. Responses from 90 multinational corporations were subjected to a LISREL analysis. Corporate culture, supply chain elements, foreign regulations and competition were identified as key determinants of planning formality. Considerable non-financial benefits also accrue as planning formality increases.","International marketing; Marketing planning; Marketing strategy; Multinationals",,"Ackoff, R.L., Planning in the systems age (1974) Systems and Management Annual, pp. 179-202; Aharoni, Y., On the definition of a multinational corporation (1971) The Quarterly Review of Economics and Business, 11 (3), pp. 27-37; Al-Bazzaz, S., Grinyer, P.H., How planning works in practice - A survey of 48 UK companies (1980) Long Range Planning, 13, pp. 30-42. , August; Andrews, K.R., (1971) The Concept of Corporate Strategy, , Dow Jones-Irwin, Homewood, IL; Ang, J.S., Chua, J.H., Long range planning in large US corporations; a survey (1979) Long Range Planning, 12 (2), pp. 99-102; Ansoff, I.H., (1965) Corporate Strategy, , McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York, NY; Armstrong, J.S., The value of formal planning for strategic decisions (1982) Strategic Management Journal, 3, pp. 197-211; Armstrong, J.S., Overton, T., Estimating non-response bias in mail surveys (1977) Journal of Marketing Research, 14, pp. 396-402. , August; Bagozzi, R.P., Yi, Y., On the evaluation of structural equation models (1988) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 16, pp. 74-94. , Spring; Bantel, K.A., Top team, environment, and performance effects on strategic planning formality (1993) Group & Organizational Management, 18 (4), pp. 436-458; Bartlett, C.A., Ghoshal, S., Managing across borders: New strategic requirements (1987) Sloan Management Review, SUMMER, pp. 7-17; Bollen, K.A., (1989) Structural Equations with Latent Variables, , John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY; Boulton, W.R., Lindsay, W.M., Franklin, S.G., Rue, L.W., How are companies planning now? - A survey (1982) Long Range Planning, 15 (1), pp. 82-86; Bresser, R.K., Bishop, R.C., Dysfunctional effects of formal planning: Two theoretical explanations (1983) Academy of Management Review, 8, pp. 588-599; Burns, T., Stalker, G.M., (1961) The Management of Innovation, , Tavistock Publications, London; Burt, D.N., Planning and performance in Australian retailing (1978) Long Range Planning, 11 (3), pp. 62-66; Cain, W.W., International planning: Mission impossible?

We distinguish between the hypotheses using profit scope economies, which measure the relative efficiency of joint versus specialized production, taking both costs and revenues into account. The results suggest that the conglomeration hypothesis dominates for some types of financial service providers and the strategic focus hypothesis dominates for other types. This may explain the empirical puzzle of why joint producers and specialists both appear to be competitively viable in the long run.

These have been discussed in a number of publications with much of the debate centring around the movement from the so-called first generation to fifth generation models of R&D management. What has not been debated to the same extent are the implications of recent and likely future trends in R&D management for the way performance is, and should be, measured. In this paper we focus on these implications, drawing upon both the existing literature on performance measurement (PM) in R&D and our own research into organisations which have chosen to move towards a more profit-centred approach to the management of their technical resources. Finally, we present and discuss the findings of our review, which indicate that although there are common features, some differences, requiring careful consideration by management, can be identified when movement from a cost- to a profit-centred approach occurs.",,,"Afuah, A., (1998) Innovation Management: Strategies, Implementation, and Profits, , New York: Oxford University Press; Amram, M., Kulatilaka, N., (1999) Real Options: Managing Strategic Investment in An Uncertain World, , Boston MA: Harvard Business School Press; Ansari, S.L., Bell, J.E., (1997) Target Costing: The next Frontier in Strategic Cost Management, , Chicago IL: Irwin Professional Publishing; Anthony, R.N., Dearden, J., (1980) Management Control Systems, 4th Edition, , Homewood, IL: Richard D.

A binomial option tree is introduced that incorporates the flexibility and the risks inherent in the NPD process into its evaluation in theoretically correct way. The proposed options-based approach ties the valuation of hitech and life sciences companies closer to the underlying growth opportunities and incorporates much of the ""gut feel"" of experienced industry practitioners into the valuation. As a consequence, the approach leads to more defensible valuations and allows powerful insights for the value-based management of technology-intensive companies. Finally, a real life situation from the biotechnology industry is described where the options-based approach was successfully applied in practice and added considerable insight and value for the company. © 2000 IEEE.",,"Industrial management; Biotechnology industry; Growth opportunities; Innovation management; ITS evaluation; Life sciences companies; New product development; Sequential model; Value-based managements; Product development","Amram, M., Kulatilaka, N., Disciplined decisions - Aligning strategy with the financial markets (1999) Harvard Business Review, pp. 95-104. , January-February; James Capel Research, (1995) Biopharmaceutical Review, , October; Courtney, H., Kirkland, J., Viguerie, P., Strategy under uncertainty (1997) Harvard Business Review, pp. 67-79. , Nov.-Dec; Hayes, R.H., Garwin, D.A., Managing as if tomorrow mattered (1982) Harvard Business Review, 60 (3), pp. 71-79. , May-June; Howell, S.D., Jägle, A.J., Evidence on how managers intuitively value growth options (1997) Journal of Business Finance and Accounting, 24 (7-8), pp. 915-935; Howell, S.D., Jägle, A.J., The evaluation of real options by managers: A potential aspect of the audit of management skills (1998) Managerial Auditing Journal, 13 (6), pp. 335-345; Hull, J.C., (1993) Options, Futures, and Other Derivative Securities, , Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J; Luehrman, T.A., Strategy as a portfolio of real options (1998) Harvard Business Review, pp. 89-99. , Sept-Oct; Newton, D., Paxson, D., Pearson, A., Real R&D options (1996) R&D Decisions, pp. 273-282. , Belcher, A, J Hassard and S Procter, Routledge, London; Nichols, N.A., Scientific management at merck: An interview with CFO judy lewent (1994) Harvard Business Review, pp. 89-99. , Jan-Feb; Rappaport, A., (1986) Creating Shareholder Value: The New Standard for Business Performance, , The Free Press, New York; Smith, J.E., Nau, R.F., Valuing risky projects: Option pricing theory and decision analysis (1995) Management Science, 41 (5), pp. 795-816; Tidd, J., Bessant, J., Pavitt, K., (1997) Managing Innovation - Integrating Technological, Market and Organisational Change, , John Wiley & Sons, Chichester; Trigeorgis, L., Real options and interactions with financial flexibility (1993) Financial Management, pp. 202-212. , Autumn",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84952039763

Inflation reached 100% in 1995 and frequent unpredictable changes in economic policies have destabilized the economic environment. Yet, some business enterprises have sustained a tradition of superior competitive performance, earning good returns on investment even as many environment-wearied multinationals divest. The aim of this paper is to examine the actions taken by two successful companies to create value in Nigeria's uncertain business environment. The paper begins with a short summary of Nigeria's economic environment and its impact on manufacturing performance. It then reviews the principles of Economic Value Added (EVA) as a measure of corporate performance. The second part of the paper analyses the performance of two selected Nigerian companies-Nigerian Breweries Plc and Dunlop Nigeria Plc-and describes the strategies these companies used to achieve high and sustained corporate performance in Nigeria's economic environment. The paper ends with a discussion on the suitability of EVA-based performance measures in uncertain business environments.","Dunlop; Managing; Nigeria; Nigerian Breweries; Uncertainty; Value","business development; economic conditions; industrial performance; manufacturing; Nigeria","Courtney, H., Kirkland, J., Vigueri, P., Strategy under Uncertainty (1997) Harvard Business Review, , Nov-Dec; Elegido, J.M., Fundamentals of Business Ethics: A Developing Country Perspective (1996) Lagos Business School Management Series, , Spectrum; Kay, J., (1993) Foundations of Corporate Success, , Oxford University Press; (1997) Reports on the Nigerian Economic Summit Reports, 1994-97, , Spectrum Books; Teriba, A.O., (1997) An EVA Study of the Top 24 Nigerian Companies, , unpublished; Teriba, A.O., Evaluation Corporate Performance: Economic Value Added (1996) LBS Management Review, 1 (2); Utomi, P., Managing Uncertainty (1998) Lagos Business School Management Series; Alos, A.J., Ehie, I.C., Measuring Company productivity using the EVA Approach (1998) Proceedings of POMS South Africa Meeting on Competitiveness and Wealth Creation: The Role of Production and Operations Management, , Cape Town, June 29; Alos, A.J., Measuring and Managing Value-based Productivity (1997) LBS Management Review, 2 (2), p. 1997; Alos, A.J., (1998) Driving to the Future: Dnnlop Nigeria Plc, , LBS Case Study; Grant, J.L., Foundations of EVA for Investment Managers (1996) Journal of Portfolio Management, pp. 41-48. , Fall; Grant, J.L., (1997) Foundations of Economic Value Added, , New Hope, PA; Frank J.

The planning process begins with an extensive situation analysis. The factors identified in the situation analysis are woven into the economic webs surrounding the new product. The webs are mapped into Bayesian networks that can be updated as events unfold and used to simulate the impact that changes in assumptions underlying the web have on the prospects for the new product. The author illustrates this method using a historical case regarding the introduction of videotape recorders by Sony and JVC and a contemporary case of the introduction of electric vehicles.

Drawing on economic and socio-psychological notions of 'network', increasing returns and social contagion effects are distinguished. Increasing returns may govern the adoption of standards when choices are binary, social contagion explains the diffusion of cultural goods when choices are multiple. Together, the four structural features delineating cultural industries account for curious competitive dynamics prevalent in cultural markets, such as the notorious 10:90 proportionality (under which 10% of cultural goods account for 90% of the market), causal ambiguity about the reasons for success, and the formation of fashions. Six managerial recommendations are advanced, focusing on a criticial circulation point triggering self-sustaining diffusion patterns.

This development is predicted dramatically to change the distribution channel structure in the retail banking sector. Two important strategic distribution channel decisions face banks. The first is whether to target the branch banking segment or the Internet banking segment. The other regards the geographical area banks aim to serve. This can be the local/national area or several nations. Based on this, four pure distribution channel strategies and a dual strategy are identified and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. © 1999, MCB UP Limited","Banking; Distribution channels; Internet; Strategy",,"Anderson, E., Day, G.S., Rangan, V.K., Strategic channel design (1997) Sloan Management Review, 38 (4), pp. 59-69; Birch, D., Young, M.A., Financial services and the Internet – what does cyberspace mean for the financial services industry?

It distills the complex cognitive processes inherent in decision making into pragmatic utility by articulating several “games”. These games, as they are described in the article, routinely undermine the best-intentioned proposals, initiatives, strategies and good ideas as they are played in ways that elude most participants. The cognitive decision processes (dubbed “games” here) are described as: Framing; Criteria setting; Misuse of analogy; Misuse of rationality; and Commitment building. The key purpose of the article is to distill complex processes into manageable dialect to improve awareness. Argues that awareness and understanding of these processes is essential to achieve influence in decision making, to avoid the pitfalls of fuzzy choice, and to promote mastery over the decision-making process. © 1999, MCB UP Limited","Cognition; Commitment; Decision making; Frames of reference",,"Brindle, M.C., Mainiero, L., (1999) Managing Power Relationships in the New Lateral Organization, , Quorum-Greenwood Press, Westport, CT; Brindle, M.C., Salancik, G.R., Processes and dependencies in medication delivery systems (1994), paper presented at the, Association for Artificial Intelligence Annual Conference, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CABrindle, M.C., Salancik, G.R., The role of power in organizational decision making (1997) Organizational Decision Making, , in, Shapira, Z.

We introduce a binomial option tree which incorporates the flexibility and the risks inherent in the NPD process into its evaluation in a theoretically correct way and is at the same time simple and easy to use. In this way, our options-based approach ties the valuation of hitech and life sciences companies closer to the underlying growth opportunities and incorporates much of the 'gut feel' of experienced industry practitioners into the valuation. As a consequence, the approach leads to more defensible valuations and allows powerful insights for the value-based management of technology-intensive companies. In two numerical examples we demonstrate that the theoretically more sound option tree approach in practice can produce different valuations and lead to different decisions than a simple 'discounted cash flow (DCF) tree' approach and has therefore potential to improve managerial decision making. Finally, we describe a real life situation where our options-based approach was successfully applied in the valuation for the initial public offering of a biotech company.",,,"Amram, M., Kulatilaka, N., Disciplined decisions - Aligning strategy with the financial markets (1999) Harvard Business Review, pp. 95-104. , January-February; Barwise, P.P., Marsh, Wensley, R., Strategic investment decisions (1987) Research in Marketing, 9, pp. 1-57; Black, A., Wright, P., Bachman, I.E., (1998) In Search of Shareholder Value, , London: Pitman Publishing; (1995) Biopharmaceutical Review, , James Capel Research October; Copeland, T., Koller, T., Murrin, J., (1995) Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies, 2nd Edition, , New York: John Wiley; Courtney, H., Kirkland, J., Viguerie, P., Strategy under uncertainty (1997) Harvard Business Review, pp. 67-79. , November-December; Donnellan, M.A., Ashton, F., King, J.F., (1998) ValueTech™: The 21st Century Strategic Enterprice Management System, a Reality Today, , Pricewaterhouse-Coopers White Paper; Venture capitalists - A really big adventure (1997) The Economist, pp. 19-21. , 25 January; Silicon valley survey (1997) The Economist, pp. 5-32. , 29 March; Grant, R.M., (1995) Contemporary Strategy Analysis, , Cambridge, Ma.: Blackwell; Hayes, R.H., Garwin, D.A., Managing as if tomorrow mattered (1982) Harvard Business Review, 60 (3), pp. 71-79. , May-June; Hodder, J.E., Riggs, H.E., Pitfalls in evaluating risky projects (1982) Harvard Business Review, pp. 128-135. , May-June; Howell, S.D., Jägle, A.J., Evidence on how managers intuitively value growth options (1997) Journal of Business Finance and Accounting, 24 (7-8), pp. 915-935; Howell, S.D., Jägle, A.J., The evaluation of real options by managers: A potential aspect of the audit of management skills (1998) Managerial Auditing Journal, 13 (6), pp. 335-345; Hull, J.C., (1993) Options, Futures, and Other Derivative Securities, , Englewood Cliffs NJ: Prentice Hall; Kester, W.C., Today's options for tomorrow's growth (1984) Harvard Business Review, 62 (2), pp. 153-160. , March-April; Luehrman, T.A., Investment opportunities as real options: Getting started on the numbers (1998) Harvard Business Review, pp. 51-67. , July-August; Luehrman, T.A., Strategy as a portfolio of real options (1998) Harvard Business Review, pp. 89-99. , September-October; Myers, S., Finance theory and financial strategy (1984) Interfaces, 1 (14), pp. 126-137; Newton, D., Paxson, D., Pearson, A., Real R&D options (1996) R&D Decisions, pp. 273-282. , Belcher, A., Hassard, J. and Procter, S.

The authors build on prior research to identify several variables that moderate the effect of manufacturer asset specificity on joint action. Drawing from transaction cost analysis and relational exchange theory, the authors propose a conceptual model that explicates the moderating role of three contextual variables: specific asset investments by the supplier (reciprocal asset investments), manufacturer decision-making uncertainty, and manufacturer trust in the supplier. Consistent with their hypotheses, results from a survey affirms in three SIC codes show that decision-making uncertainty and trust enhance the effect of manufacturer asset specificity on joint action. Contrary to expectation, however, the moderating effect of reciprocal asset investments was not significant. Theoretical and managerial implications of the results are discussed.

Because this is often framed around whether sprawling development patterns are harmful or beneficial to the economy and environment, we are seemingly presented with an either/or choice. This article asserts that the debate misses the reality that metropolitan development occurs as part of a complex system. If we view metropolitan development as a complex system, there is no fundamental conflict between environmental goals and economic development. Examining the case of California, the authors demonstrate how the relationship between these is part of a larger system involving fiscal policy, governance structure, infrastructure policy, and other factors. The authors propose three strategies for improving metropolitan system performance to ensure sustainable metropolitan economies and environments: developing and using indicators for self-organizing urban systems, collaboration and consensus building among metropolitan stakeholders, and metropolitan leadership.",,,"(1995) Alternatives for Future Urban Growth in California's Central Valley: The Bottom Line for Agriculture and Taxpayers, , Washington, DC: Author; Argyris, C., Schön, D.A., (1974) Theory in Practice: Increasing Professional Effectiveness, , San Francisco: Jossey-Bass; (1995) Beyond Sprawl: New Patterns of Growth to Fit the New California, , San Francisco, CA: Author; Bennis, W., (1989) On Becoming a Leader, , Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley; Blakely, E., Snyder, M.G., (1997) Fortress America: The Rise of Gated Communities, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Booher, D., Reforming California's governance for the next millennium (1997) Western City, 73 (10), pp. 4-8; Bryson, J.M., Crosby, B.C., (1992) Leadership for the Common Good: Tackling Public Problems in a Shared Power World, , San Francisco: Jossey-Bass; (1996) Final Report and Recommendations to the Governor and Legislature, , Sacramento, CA: Author; (1997) Restoring the Balance: Managing Fiscal Issues and Land Use Planning Decisions in California, , San Diego, CA: Author; Capra, F., (1982) The Turning Point, , New York: Simon & Schuster; Capra, F., (1996) The Web of Life: A New Scientific Understanding of Living Systems, , New York: Anchor; Castells, M., (1996) The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture.

The first is whether to target the branch banking segment or the Internet banking segment. The other regards the geographical area banks aim to serve.

Drawing on economic and socio-psychological notions of 'network', increasing returns and social contagion effects are distinguished. Increasing returns may govern the adoption of standards when choices are binary, social contagion explains the diffusion of cultural goods when choices are multiple. Together, the four structural features delineating cultural industries account for curious competitive dynamics prevalent in cultural markets, such as the notorious 10:90 proportionality (under which 10% of cultural goods account for 90% of the market), causal ambiguity about the reasons for success, and the formation of fashions. Six managerial recommendations are advanced, focusing on a criticial circulation point triggering self-sustaining diffusion patterns. Finally 'project-based enterprises' and 'network forms of governance' are identified as the organizational forms most suited to the dynamics of the cultural markets.",,,"Abrahamson, E., Managerial Fads and Fashions: The Diffusion and Rejection of Innovations (1991) Academy of Management Review, 16, pp. 586-612; Abrahamson, E., Management Fashion (1996) Academy of Management Review, 21, pp. 254-285; Abrahamson, E., Fombrun, C.J., Forging the Iron Cage: Interorganizational Networks and the Production of Macro-Culture (1992) Journal of Management Studies, 29, pp. 175-194; Abrahamson, E., Fombrun, C.J., Macrocultures: Determinants and Consequences (1994) Academy of Management Review, 19, pp. 728-755; Abrahamson, E., Rosenkopf, L., Institutional and Competitive Bandwagons: Using Mathematical Modelling As A Tool to Explore Innovation Diffusion (1993) Academy of Management Review, 18, pp. 487-517; Abrahamson, E., Rosenkopf, L., Social Network Effects on the Extent of Innovation Diffusion: A Computer Simulation (1997) Organization Science, 8, pp. 289-309; Anand, N., Peterson, R.A., When Market Information Constitutes Fields: The Case of the Billboard Album Chart (1997) Research Perspectives on the Management of Cultural Industries, , New York University: Stern School of Business; Arthur, W.B., (1994) Increasing Returns and Path Dependence in the Economy, , University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor; Arthur, W.B., Increasing Returns and the New World of Business (1996) Harvard Business Review, pp. 100-109. , July-August; Banerjee, A., A Simple Model of Herd Behavior (1992) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 107, pp. 797-817; Besen, S.M., Farrell, J., Choosing How to Compete: Strategies and Tactics in Standardization (1994) Journal of Economic Perspectives, 8, pp. 117-131; Bikhchandani, S., Hirshleifer, D., Welch, I., A Theory of Fads, Fashion, Custom and Cultural Change As Information Cascades (1992) Journal of Political Economy, 100, pp. 992-1026; Bovasso, G., A Network Analysis of Social Contagion Processes in an Organizational Intervention (1996) Human Relations, 49, pp. 1419-1435; Brandenburger, A.M., Nalebuff, B.J., The Right Game: Use Game Theory to Shape Strategy (1995) Harvard Business Review, , July-August; Burnett, R., (1996) The Global Jukebox: The International Music Industry, , Routledge, London; Burt, R.S., Social Contagion and Innovation: Cohesion versus Structural Equivalence (1987) American Journal of Sociology, 92, pp. 1287-1335; Burt, R.S., (1992) Social Contagion, , Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA; Caves, R., The Economic Organization of Creative Industries (1997) British Academy of Management Annual Conference, , London; Choi, C.J., Hilton, B., Client Base, Age and Competitive Advantage in the Services Sector (1995) Journal of Marketing Management, 11, pp. 71-82; Courtney, H., Kirkland, J., Viguerie, P., Strategy under Uncertainty (1997) Harvard Business Review, (NOV-DEC), pp. 67-79; Dalton, M., (1959) Men Who Manage, , Wiley, New York; Darby, M., Karni, E., Free Competition and the Optimal Amount of Fraud (1973) Journal of Law and Economics, 16, pp. 67-88; D'Aveni, R.A., (1994) Hypercompetition: Managing the Dynamics of Strategic Maneuvering, , Free Press, New York; DeFillippi, R.J., Arthur, M.B., Paradox in Project-Based Enterprise: The Case of Film Making (1998) California Management Review, 40, pp. 1-15; Porn on the Net (1997) Economist, , 4 January; Slipped disc (1998) Economist, , 3 January; Farrell, J., Saloner, G., Standardization, Compatibility and Innovation (1985) Rand Journal of Economics, 16, pp. 70-83; Fombrun, R., (1995) Reputation, , Harvard Business School, Boston, MA; Frank, R.H., Cook, P.J., (1995) The Winner-Take-All Society, , Free Press, New York; Granovetter, M., Threshold Models of Collective Behavior (1978) American Journal of Sociology, 83, pp. 1420-1443; Granovetter, M., Economic Action and Social Structure: The Problem of Embeddedness (1985) American Journal of Sociology, 91, pp. 481-510; Handy, C., (1991) The Age of Unreason, , Arrow Business Books, London; Hirsch, P., Processing Fads and Fashions: An Organization Set Analysis of Cultural Industry Systems (1972) American Journal of Sociology, 77 (4); (1996) Nichtkäufer Motivation (Non-Buyer Motivation), , Study commissioned by the German music industry.

Econ., Purdue Univ., West Lafayette, IN 47907-1145, United States","Site-specific (SSF) practices are being adopted at an accelerating rate, but evidence of their profitability has been mixed or missing. This contribution evaluates the profitability of SSF practices by synthesizing quantitative and qualitative research results within the context of the economics of information technology. The profitability results from nine published field research studies on variable rate (VR) fertilizer application are reviewed using partial budgets adjusted to include minimum costs and grid cell areas for each study. Profitability results correlated closely with the gross revenue earning potential of the crop, so VR fertilizer application was unprofitable on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), sometimes profitable on corn (Zea mays L.), and profitable on sugarbeet (Beta vulgaris subsp. L. vulgaris). Although the formal published literature has ignored the profitability of yield mapping, production economics and farmer interviews suggest that yield mapping is profitable when it reveals yield patterns that can be managed at acceptable cost and when the information has compensating off-field value. Manageable yield variability includes not only VR input management, but also whole-field improvements such as field drainage, land leveling, windbreaks, and fencing. Off-field value can come from cheaper on-farm experimentation and greater negotiating power with landlords. Farmers and agribusinesses committed to field crop production for the long term should develop SSF capabilities. But because SSF practices are site-specific, their profitability potential too is site-specific. This site specificity extends beyond the farm field to the crop rotation, and the capabilities and opportunities available to the farm or agribusiness manager.",,"Beta vulgaris; Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris; Hordeum; Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays","Akridge, J.T., Whipker, L.D., (1997) 1997 Precision Agricultural Services Dealership Survey Results, , Purdue Univ.
