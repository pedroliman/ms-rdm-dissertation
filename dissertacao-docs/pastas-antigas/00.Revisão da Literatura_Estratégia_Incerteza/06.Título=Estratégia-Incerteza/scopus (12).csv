Data include interviews and archival documents from five New Zealand electricity generators. We construct a theoretical framework that links climate change risks and opportunities to strategic responses. Climate change risk exposure increased during the period due to changes in the estimation/perception of climate change risks, market opportunities and regulatory uncertainty. Organisations' strategies changed in response, moving from a stable strategy to different combinations of anticipatory, proactive, and creative strategies, and finally regressing to a reactive strategy. Carbon management accounting changed to support the new strategy adopted in each time period. Long term physical and monetarised accounts for sustainability and extensive use of carbon information were prevalent during periods when the companies employed a proactive or creative strategy. In contrast, short-term physical accounts for unsustainability and limited use in decision-making were observed when the companies adopted stable, anticipatory or reactive strategies. Regulatory uncertainty was found to be the major constraint to a proactive strategy and carbon management accounting development in response to climate change. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Business strategy; Carbon management accounting; Climate change; Risk",,"Aragón-Correa, J.A., Rubio-López, A., Proactive corporate environmental Strategies: Myths and misunderstandings (2007) Long Range Planning, 40 (3), pp. 357-381; Arena, M., Arnaboldi, M., Azzone, G., The organizational dynamics of enterprise risk management (2010) Accounting, Organizations and Society, 35 (7), pp. 659-675; Arjaliès, D.-L., Mundy, J., The use of management control systems to manage CSR strategy: A levers of control perspective (2013) Management Accounting Research, 24 (4), pp. 284-300; Ascui, F., Lovell, H., As frames collide: Making sense of carbon accounting (2011) Accounting, Auditing & Accountability Journal, 24 (8), pp. 978-999; Atkins, J., Maroun, W., Integrated reporting in South Africa in 2012: Perspectives from South African institutional investors (2015) Meditari Accountancy Research, 23 (2), pp. 197-221; Atkins, J.F., Solomon, A., Norton, S., Joseph, N.L., The emergence of integrated private reporting (2015) Meditari Accountancy Research, 23 (1), pp. 28-61; Azzone, G., Bertelè, U., Exploiting green strategies for competitive advantage (1994) Long Range Planning, 27 (6), pp. 69-81; Bebbington, J., Larrinaga-Gonzalez, C., Carbon Trading: Accounting and reporting issues (2008) European Accounting Review, 17 (4), pp. 697-717; Beck, U., Risk society: Towards a new modernity (1992), Sage Publications Inc LondonBhimani, A., Risk management, corporate governance and management accounting: Emerging interdependencies (2009) Management Accounting Research, 20 (1), pp. 2-5; Boiral, O., Global Warming: Should companies adopt a proactive strategy?

The manufacturer distributes one kind of seasonal product via the retailer to the end market, whose demand is random, and the manufacturer's production yield is stochastic. We study the retailer's optimal ordering policy and the manufacturer's optimal production strategy under two different option contracts (that is, commitment-unidirectional call option contract and commitment-bidirectional option contract). The effects of demand uncertainty, production yield stochastic volatility, instant procurement price variability, and the price parameters’ changes of option contracts on the optimal operational strategies and performances of both participants are also analyzed. These results will be helpful for the manufacturers and retailers in the supply chain with seasonal products to make production scheduling strategy and procurement policy feasibly and scientifically. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Commitment-option contract; Random yield; Seasonal product; Supply chain","Decision making; Game theory; Manufacture; Production; Production control; Sales; Stochastic systems; Uncertainty analysis; Decentralized supply chains; Decision making models; Operational strategies; Optimal ordering policy; Optimal production strategies; Option contracts; Random yield; Seasonal product; Supply chains","Arani, H.V., Rabbani, M., Rafiei, H., A revenue-sharing option contract toward coordination of supply chains (2016) Int.

Although genetic testing may reduce previvors’ worries about whether or not they have a high genetic cancer risk, testing positive produces negative emotions and long-term uncertainty—thus requiring the management of uncertainty. Existing research indicates family, friends, and social support networks are limited in their assistance for previvors’ uncertainty management. Therefore, this study examined how health care providers may assist previvors in uncertainty management by asking: What strategies do BRCA-positive previvors enact with their health care providers to help manage their uncertainty about HBOC? Purposive sampling was employed to recruit participants via online social media. The final sample consisted of 34 BRCA-positive women. Interviews revealed four uncertainty management strategies—seeking health care providers as informational sources, seeking health care providers as partners for decision making, seeking health care providers for supportive communication, and seeking referrals from health care providers for social support networks.

Using data from a survey of 302 new ventures based in China, we find that new ventures respond to a high environmental uncertainty by engaging more in prospector strategy, consequently enhancing the ventures’ performance. Moreover, we find that network capabilities significantly moderate these relationships by not only strengthening the relationship between environmental uncertainty and engagement in the prospector strategy (the E–S relationship) but also by enhancing the relationship between engagement in the prospector strategy and new venture performance (the S–P relationship). Our findings extend the environment, strategy, and performance paradigm from large firms to small new ventures, highlighting the importance of network capabilities in a new venture’s engagement in an innovative strategy and of performance outcomes in a transition economy with a generally high level of environmental uncertainty. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Environment-strategy-performance (E-S-P); Environmental uncertainty; Network capability; New venture performance; Prospector strategy; Transition economy",,"Adler, N.J., Brahm, R., Graham, J.L., Strategy implementation: a comparison of face‐to‐face negotiations in the Peoples Republic of China and the United States (1992) Strategic Management Journal, 13 (6), pp. 449-466; Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., Reno, R., (1991) Multiple regression: Testing and interpreting interactions., , Sage; Allaire, Y., Firsirotu, M.E., Coping with strategic uncertainty (1989) Sloan Management Review, 30 (3), pp. 7-16; Aragón-Sánchez, A., Sánchez-Marín, G., Strategic orientation, management characteristics, and performance: a study of Spanish SMEs (2005) Journal of Small Business Management, 43 (3), pp. 287-308; Bantel, K.A., Technology-based, “adolescent” firm configurations, strategy identification, context, and performance (1998) Journal of Business Venturing, 13 (3), pp. 205-230; Baron, R.A., Markman, G.D., Beyond social capital, the role of entrepreneurs’ social competence in their financial success (2003) Journal of Business Venturing, 18 (1), pp. 41-60; Batjargal, B., Liu, M., Entrepreneurs’ access to private equity in China, the role of social capital (2004) Organization Science, 15 (2), pp. 159-172; Batjargal, B., Hitt, M., Tsui, A., Arregle, J.L., Webb, J., Miller, T., Institutional polycentrism, entrepreneurs’ social networks and new venture growth (2013) Academy of Management Journal, 56 (4), pp. 1024-1049; Baum, J.R., Locke, E.A., Smith, K.G., A multidimensional model of venture growth (2001) Academy of Management Journal, 44 (2), pp. 292-303; Bestieler, L., The moderating effect of environmental uncertainty on new product development and time efficiency (2005) Journal of Product Innovation Management, 22 (3), pp. 267-284; Chaganti, R.R.S., Watts, A.D., Chaganti, R., Zimmerman-Treichel, M., Ethnic-immigrants in founding teams, effects on prospector strategy and performance in new internet ventures (2008) Journal of Business Venturing, 23 (1), pp. 113-139; Chang, S.J., Van Witteloostuijn, A., Eden, L., From the editors, common method variance in international business research (2010) Journal of International Business Studies, 41 (2), pp. 178-184; Chen, M.H., Chang, Y.Y., Lee, C.Y., Creative entrepreneurs’ guanxi networks and success, information and resource (2015) Journal of Business Research, 68 (4), pp. 900-905; Cohen, W.M., Levinthal, D.A., Absorptive capacity, a new perspective on learning and innovation (1990) Administrative Science Quarterly, 35 (1), pp. 128-152; Covin, J.G., Slevin, D.P., Strategic management of small firms in hostile and benign environments (1989) Strategic Management Journal, 10 (1), pp. 75-87; Cray, D., Control and coordination in multinational corporations (1984) Journal of International Business Studies, 15 (2), pp. 85-98; Daft, R.L., Weick, K.E., Toward a model of organizations as interpretation systems (1984) Academy of Management Review, 9 (2), pp. 284-295; Davies, H., Walters, P., Emergent patterns of strategy, environment and performance in a transition economy (2004) Strategic Management Journal, 25 (4), pp. 347-364; Davig, W., Business strategies in smaller manufacturing firms (1986) Journal of Small Business Management, 24 (1), pp. 38-46; Desarbo, W.S., Di Benedetto, C.A., Song, M., Sinha, I., Revisiting the miles and snow strategic framework: uncovering interrelationships between strategic types, capabilities, environmental uncertainty, and firm performance (2005) Strategic Management Journal, 26 (1), pp. 47-74; Dess, G.G., Lumpkin, G.T., Covin, J.G., Entrepreneurial strategy making and firm performance, tests of contingency and configurational models (1997) Strategic Management Journal, 18 (9), pp. 677-695; Dolphin, R.R., Internal communications, today’s strategic imperative (2005) Journal of Marketing Communications, 11 (3), pp. 171-190; Doz, Y.L., The evolution of cooperation in strategic alliances, initial conditions or learning processes?

We develop a classification of project complexity by relying on fundamental theoretical insights about complexity and then use results from practice-oriented literature to assign concrete project complexity factors to the resulting categories. We also identify specific strategies for organizing and knowledge production that project planners use to address complexity-related uncertainties. We theorize about the way these strategies interact with various types of complexity to increase project performance. Anticipated influences are mostly corroborated using survey data on 81 complex projects from five continents and a diversity of sectors. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Association for Project Management and the International Project Management Association","Complexity; Knowledge; Organization; Planning; Uncertainty","Planning; Project management; Societies and institutions; Complex projects; Complexity; Knowledge; Knowledge production; Project complexity; Project performance; Uncertainty; Uncertainty reduction; Innovation","Aaltonen, K., Project stakeholder analysis as an environmental interpretation process (2011) Int.

Among many embedded communication tools in SNS, our study focuses on fan pages and page followers, highlighting their continuous visiting behavior to company fan pages in the context of Facebook. Based on uncertainty reduction theory, our study proposes a research model examining the relationship between uncertainty reduction strategies and continuous visiting behavior, mediated by the low level of uncertainty. In addition, we employ the perceived usefulness of postings on fan pages as a mediator between uncertainty and visiting behavior. Lastly, we adopt two moderating factors: SNS satisfaction and SNS loyalty. To test hypotheses, we analyzed survey data from 189 Facebook users who have subscribed to at least one fan page on Facebook using a partial least squares (PLS) method. We found that uncertainty reduction strategies are positively associated with a low level of uncertainty about information regarding products or services on fan pages. In addition, perceived usefulness of postings is significantly accounted for by the low level of uncertainty. Both the low level of uncertainty and usefulness of postings explain continuous visiting behavior jointly. Our research findings also revealed that SNS satisfaction and SNS loyalty have significant moderating effects on the relationships between the low level of uncertainty/perceived usefulness and continuous visiting behavior. Based on research findings, implications and limitations are discussed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Continuous visiting behavior; Loyalty; Perceived usefulness; Satisfaction; SNS fan page; Uncertainty reduction theory","Least squares approximations; Websites; Continuous visiting behavior; Loyalty; Perceived usefulness; Satisfaction; Uncertainty reduction theory; Social networking (online)",,"Shin, S.I.email: shins@uwgb.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",07365853,,TEINE,,"English","Telematics Inf",Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011022896

However, this ignores that such transformations, while often essential, come at a cost. They are not always necessary, and may not even be possible. This article explores agility at a more fundamental level and relates it more specifically to dynamic capabilities. It demonstrates that it is first essential to understand deep uncertainty, which is ubiquitous in the innovation economy. Uncertainty is very different from risk, which can be managed using traditional tools and approaches. Strong dynamic capabilities are necessary for fostering the organizational agility necessary to address deep uncertainty, such as that generated by innovation and the associated dynamic competition. This article explores the mechanisms by which managers may calibrate the required level of organizational agility, deliver it cost effectively, and relate it to strategy. © 2016 by The Regents of the University of California.

To do so, we link the Activity System framework to the concept of perceived vulnerability and analyse the small-scale farmers' trajectories. Based on a sample of 34 small-scale coffee producers in Guatemala and through the analysis of case studies and classification methods, we identify some trends in long-term decisionmaking. These trends are mainly built on responsiveness, autonomy, vulnerability shifts and collective means of action. We finally discuss these findings in the light of previous studies carried out in different contexts. © 2016 Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers).","Activity system; Central America; Guatemala; Long-term strategies; Perceived vulnerability; Smallholder",,"Ancey, V., Avelange, I., Dedieu, B., (2013) Agir en situation d'incertitude en agriculture: Regards pluridisciplinaires au Nord et au Sud, , eds Peter Lang International Academic Publishers, Bruxelles; Anthony, D., Cooperation in microcredit borrowing groups: identity, sanctions, and reciprocity in the production of collective goods (2005) American Sociological Review, 70, pp. 496-515; Astigarraga, L., Ingrand, S., Production flexibility in extensive beef farming systems (2011) Ecology and Society, 16; Audouin, S., Lorgeron, F., 'Lumières sur les cafés ombragés' Unpublished thesis (2009), Master II SupagroBathfield, B., Estrategias adaptativas y gestiones técnicas de los pequeños productores de café y miel en los altos de Guatemala' Unpublished thesis (2013), El Colegio de la Frontera SurBathfield, B., Gasselin, P., López-Ridaura, S., Vandame, R., A flexibility framework to understand the adaptation of small coffee and honey producers facing market shocks (2013) The Geographical Journal, 179, pp. 356-368; Billaud, J.-P., L'individu et le collectif dans le traitement de l'incertitude (2013) Agir en situation d'incertitude en agriculture, pp. 409-414. , in Lang P ed Regards pluridisciplinaires au Nord et au Sud, Bruxelles -; Cochet, H., The 'systeme agraire' concept in francophone peasant studies (2012) Geoforum, 43, pp. 128-136; Courade, G., Paupérisation et inégalités d'accès aux ressources (2001) Inégalités et politiques publiques en Afrique.

Education used to be considered a public good, provided by nonprofit organizations that were unexposed to market pressure and had clear societal missions. Now, education is becoming a global service delivered by quasi-companies in an ever-more complex and competitive knowledge marketplace. To cope with these challenges, higher education institutions need an appropriate strategy, a necessity reflected in numerous calls for research on strategy in the higher education sector. This article's purpose is to contribute to this discussion by providing prescriptive guidance to higher education managers and policy makers. To this end, it proposes a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis illustrating eight key trends that will impact higher education and academia in the short-to-medium term. Drawing from these trends, three core challenges are identified that higher education institutions will face and that have fundamental implications for research and practice: (1) the need to enhance prestige and market share; (2) the need to embrace an entrepreneurial mindset; and (3) the need to expand interactions and value co-creation with key stakeholders. © 2016 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.","Academia; Alumni; Business schools; Higher education; Public service; Research; Strategy; Teaching; University management",,"Altbach, P.G., Globalisation and the university: Myths and realities in an unequal world (2004) Tertiary Education and Management, 10 (1), pp. 3-25; Altbach, P.G., Reisberg, L., Rumbley, L.E., (2009) Trends in global higher education: Tracking an academic revolution.

The two suppliers, acting as the Stackelberg leaders, produce substitutable products and distribute them through each exclusive retailer, and can provide either a consignment contract or a wholesale-price contract. The equilibrium behaviours of the suppliers and retailers are investigated in three different scenarios: (1) the consignment contract scenario; (2) the wholesale-price contract scenario; and (3) the hybrid contract scenario. We prove that the equilibrium contracting strategy is of the threshold type: when the cost-share rates of the two retailers are above certain thresholds, both suppliers select consignment contracts; when the cost-share rates of the two retailers are lower than certain thresholds, both suppliers select wholesale-price contracts; when one retailer's cost-share rate is above a certain threshold and the other is lower than a certain threshold, the supplier with large retailer's cost-share rate selects the consignment contract and the other supplier with small retailer's cost-share rate selects the wholesale-price contract. Furthermore, these thresholds depend on price sensitivities. © 2016 Operational Research Society Ltd.

Six resilience strategies are proposed to mitigate the risk of correlated disruptions. In addition, an efficient parallel Taguchi-based memetic algorithm is developed that incorporates a customized hybrid parallel adaptive large neighborhood search. Fitness landscape analysis is used to determine an effective selection of neighborhood structures, while the upper bound found by Lagrangian relaxation heuristic is used to evaluate quality of solutions and effectiveness of the proposed metaheuristic. The model is solved for a real-life case of a global medical device manufacturer to extract managerial insights. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Disruption management; Fitness landscape analysis; Global supply chain network design; Parallel memetic algorithm; Resilience strategies; Robust optimization","algorithm; network design; numerical model; optimization; uncertainty analysis","Altiparmak, F., Gen, M., Lin, L., Karaoglan, I., A steady-state genetic algorithm for multi-product supply chain network design (2008) Comput.

The farmers' strategies vary along a continuum from accommodation with dominant institutions to precautions of possible uncertainty to innovations and oppositions of potential uncertainty. Significantly these strategies are contradictory and they show variations in power and morality. The data indicate a subjective- and practice-oriented response that I call localized, relational uncertainty. It is contextualized in farms and villages with responsibility for family, consumers, and organic agriculture itself and it enables farmers to embrace multiple strategies. Thus, uncertainty brings loss and limitations, but also produces opportunities through, for example, expanded trust in relationships, deepened commitment to place, reinterpretation of organic agriculture, and sharpened critique of Japan's trajectory of economic growth. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Disaster; Japan; organic agriculture; risk; uncertainty",,"Aldritch, D., Rethinking Civil Society-State Relations in Japan after the Fukushima Accident (2013) Polity, 45 (2), pp. 249-264; Auyero, J., Swistun, D.A., (2009) Flammable: Environmental Suffering in an Argentine Shantytown., , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Beck, U., (1992) Risk Society: Towards a New Modernity, , London: Sage; Berking, H., Solidary Individualism (1996) Risk, Environment and Modernity: Towards a New Ecology, pp. 189-202. , Lash S., Szerszynski B., Wynne B., (eds), Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications; Boholm, A., The Cultural Nature of Risk: Can There Be an Anthropology of Uncertainty?

Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is a promising alternative since it could reduce emissions substantially and offer potential fuel cost savings. But the investment in LNG fuelled vessels is currently facing a high degree of uncertainty, such as the differential between the prices of LNG and conventional maritime fuels, the availability of LNG, and the reliability of its supply chain. This paper makes an attempt to study the possibility of investing in LNG powered vessels under uncertainty. A deferral option model is proposed to quantify the value of flexibility for a deferral based on multi-variables following specified stochastic processes. By exploiting the stochastic processes, it is possible to determine the value of deferral by solving a dynamic program using a least squares Monte Carlo simulation. The model is tested on an investment of a new chemical vessel with 19,000 deadweight tonnage (dwt) powered by LNG. Empirical analysis may suggest different investment strategies based on the probabilities of exercising an option, and related option values each year, and it indicates further that the attractiveness of LNG as a ship fuel is dominated by three parameters: difference of ship prices between a LNG powered vessel and a reference one, price difference between LNG and conventional fuel prices, and the share of operation time inside emission control areas (ECAs). © 2016 ASCE.","Deferral option model; Environmental compliance; LNG powered vessel; Monte Carlo simulation","Alternative fuels; Costs; Emission control; Fuels; Gas emissions; Intelligent systems; Investments; Liquefied natural gas; Monte Carlo methods; Multimodal transportation; Planning; Random processes; Ships; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Strategic planning; Supply chains; Deferral option; Degree of uncertainty; Empirical analysis; Environmental compliance; International maritime organizations; Investment strategy; Least squares monte carlo; Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG); Tankers (ships)","Acciaro, M., Real option analysis for environmental compliance: LNG and emission control areas (2014) Journal of Transport Research Part D, 28 (1), pp. 41-50; Acciaro, M., Hoffmann, P.N., Eide, M.S., The energy efficiency gap in maritime transport (2013) International Journal of Shipping Ocean Engineering, 3 (10), pp. 1-11; Alizadeh, A.H., Nomikos, N.K., (2009) Shipping Derivatives and Risk Management, , Palgrave MacMillan, Basingstoke, UK; Amram, M., Kulatilaka, N., (1999) Real Options: Managing Strategic Investment in An Uncertain World, , Harvard Business School Press, Boston; Benaroch, M., Kauffman, R.J., Justifying electronic banking network expansion using real option analysis (2000) MIS Quarter, 24 (2), pp. 197-225; Benaroch, M., Managing information technology investment risk: A real options perspective (2002) Journal of Management Information Systems, 19 (2), pp. 43-65; Brennan, M., Schwartz, E., The valuation of American put options (1977) Journal of Finance, 32, pp. 449-462; Bendall, H.B., Stent, A.F., Investment decision stategies in an uncertain world: A real options approach to investments in the maritime industry (2002) Proceedings ICHCA 2002, 26th Biennial Conference, pp. 197-218. , Yokohama, Japan. 13-15 April; Bendall, H.B., Valuing maritime investments using real options (2002) The Handbook of Maritime Economics and Business, , edited by C.

To set the charging prices, the service providers faces three uncertainties: the volatility of wholesale electricity price, intermittent renewable energy generation, and spatial-temporal EV charging demand. The main objective of our work here is to help charging service providers to improve their total profits while enhancing customer satisfaction and maintaining power grid stability, taking into account those uncertainties. We employ a linear regression model to estimate the EV charging demand at each charging station, and introduce a quantitative measure for customer satisfaction. Both the greedy algorithm and the dynamic programming (DP) algorithm are employed to derive the optimal charging prices and determine how much electricity to be purchased from the wholesale market in each planning horizon. Simulation results show that DP algorithm achieves an increased profit (up to 9%) compared to the greedy algorithm (the benchmark algorithm) under certain scenarios. Additionally, we observe that the integration of a low-cost energy storage into the system can not only improve the profit, but also smooth out the charging price fluctuation, protecting the end customers from the volatile wholesale market. © Copyright 2016 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Besides the regular production run, the manufacturer may choose the outsourcing mode due to his production disruption risk and uncertainty of capacity allocation. We find that the manufacturer has no incentive to outsource when both the disruption risk is low enough and his production capacity is large enough. When the disruption risk is sufficiently high, the manufacturer will fully outsource production regardless of the production capacity. There is a zone of order-difference outsourcing where the manufacturer just outsources the part in excess of the certain threshold value. Under the retailer-Stackelberg (RS) game, the manufacturer's order-difference outsourcing strategy can induce the retailer to order more items. Unlike RS, the retailer in the manufacturer-Stackelberg (MS) game always orders a quantity equal to that in the classic newsvendor model. Meanwhile, we find that the channel power does not affect the player's decision except in the zone of order-difference outsourcing. Compared with MS, the dominant retailer can better deal with the uncertainties and make better use of demand information. From the channel's perspective, the two players have the different attitudes towards the risks. The dominant manufacturer prefers to forcibly offload production risks to his partner, while the dominant retailer in RS actively takes the partner's risks. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper focuses on decision strategies that account for uncertainties by deciding whether a proposed list of policy options should be accepted or revised (scope strategies) and whether to decide now or later (timing strategies). They can be used in participatory approaches to structure the decision process. As a basis, we propose to classify the broad range of uncertainties affecting policy decision problems along two dimensions, source of uncertainty (incomplete information, inherent indeterminacy and unreliable information) and location of uncertainty (information about policy options, outcomes and values). Decision strategies encompass multiple and vague criteria to be deliberated in application. As an example, we discuss which decision strategies may account for the uncertainties related to nutritive technologies that aim at reducing methane (CH<inf>4</inf>) emissions from ruminants as a means of mitigating climate change, limiting our discussion to published scientific information. These considerations not only speak in favour of revising rather than accepting the discussed list of options, but also in favour of active postponement or semi-closure of decision-making rather than closure or passive postponement. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate change; Decision making; Methane; Ruminant; Timing strategy; Uncertainty","methane; Article; behavior; climate change; decision making; decision support system; decision theory; environmental planning; livestock; policy; priority journal; ruminant; social problem; society; uncertainty","Beauchemin, K.A., Kreuzer, A., O'Mara, F., McAllister, T.A., Nutritional management for enteric methane abatement: a review (2008) Aust.

We find that when consumers have the option to self-mend a product to assure a proper fit, an online retailer can devise its return policy to encourage or suppress consumer mending as a fit-uncertainty mitigating mechanism. First, our analysis shows that an online retailer benefits from easing the return policy and lowering the consumer return cost if the value of a good fit product is low, but benefits from tightening the return policy and maintaining a reasonable return cost for consumers if the value of a good fit product is high. Second, we find that in the parameter region where the value of a good fit product is high but not too high, a tightened return policy leads to a greater consumer surplus in addition to an increased retailer profit, suggesting a win-win situation and improved social efficiency. And even beyond this win-win region, the social welfare may still increase with tightened return policy when the gains in retailer profit or consumer surplus exceeds the loss of the other party. Finally, we show that when the value of a good fit product is sufficiently high, the capability of manipulating consumer mending as a fit-uncertainty mitigating mechanism allows a pure online retailer to earn a greater profit than a dual channel retailer that sells the product through both the online and the offline channels. Our theoretical insights provide explanations to many interesting practices in the online retailing industry. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Fit uncertainty; Mending; Online retailing; Return policy",,"Adams, R.

His main supplier's production process is uncertain, and he can either choose pricing flexibility (setting prices depending on the available supply) or operational flexibility (requesting a contingent order from a backup supplier). As the buyer may or may not find a suitable contingent supplier ex post, we study two scenarios that the backup supplier's supply is infinite, and that this supply is random. We also include the factor that the main supplier may determine the wholesale price. We demonstrate that the adoption of flexibility strategies is controlled by threshold policies in different scenarios whether the main supplier determines the wholesale price or not. We also investigate how the buyer's attribute (finding a suitable contingent supplier) affects the configuration of flexibility strategies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Flexibility strategy; Game theory; Random capacity;

Periodic environmental cycles such as the moon phase can have important effects on fishing strategies by regulating the behavior of stocks and tides. Traditional lunar calendars are used by subsistence fishermen to decide when and where to go fishing. Environmental uncertainty, specifically unprecedented changes in oceanographic and atmospheric conditions, is threatening the predictability of traditional systems of ecological knowledge. Methodology/approach - Methods included ethnographic and observational techniques. Interviews (n = 58) and surveys (n =132) are qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. A combination of standard statistical tests, multilevel models, and cluster analysis is applied to long-term repeated observations of fishing events (n = 2,633). Findings - Endenese fishermen emphasized the importance of the traditional lunar calendar to allocate their effort in interviews and surveys. This belief does not coincide with observed behavior. Contrary to expectations from the traditional calendar, the lowest probability of fishing happens in the intermediate phases, with fishing also occurring during the full moon. Differences between individuals play an important role in explaining variability in returns. Finally, based on the consideration of variability, three different fishing strategies are identified that suggest an effect of environmental uncertainty in effort regulation. Research implications - The paper underlines the importance of studies of variability to identify behavioral flexibility and adaptation. Results emphasize the value of considering individual traits in the analysis of subsistence practices.

This paper examines how regulatory uncertainty affects decision making through an empirical study of the ‘Pay for Permit’ policy in the Tai Lake Basin in China. The results show that firms’ willingness to decrease pollution is positively influenced by their perceived attitudes, social pressure, and perceived behavioural control. In addition, perceived regulatory uncertainty has significant impacts on social pressure and attitudes toward pollution control. Firms that perceive less regulatory uncertainty are more inclined to adopt antipollution strategies under the Pay for Permit policy. To reduce regulatory uncertainty, China’s policy makers should maintain a consistent level of environmental regulations, set clear and reliable long-term policy targets, and strengthen policy enforcement. © 2015 Pion and its Licensors.","Corporate environmental strategies; Pay for permit; Regulatory uncertainty; Theory of planned behaviour","business; decision making; environmental economics; environmental fate; environmental policy; environmental protection; investment; pollution control; regulatory approach; strategic approach; China; Taihu Lake","Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behavior (1991) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Process, 50, pp. 179-211; Andrews, C.J., Environmental business strategy: Corporate leaders' perceptions (1998) Society and Natural Resources, 11, pp. 531-540; Arentsen, M.J., Bressers, H.T.A., O'Toole, L.J., Institutional and policy responses to uncertainty in environmental policy: A comparison of Dutch and US styles (2000) Policy Studies Journal, 28, pp. 597-611; Armitage, C.J., Conner, M., Efficacy of the theory of planned behaviour: A meta-analytic review (2001) British Journal of Social Psychology, 40, pp. 471-499; Bagozzi, R.P., Yi, Y., On the evaluation of structural equation models (1988) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 16, pp. 74-94; Birnbaum, P.H., The choice of strategic alternatives under increasing regulation in high technology companies (1984) The Academy of Management Journal, 27, pp. 489-510; Boehmer-Christiansen, S., Reflections on the politics linking science, environment and innovation (1995) Innovations, 8, pp. 275-287; Boyd, B.K., Dess, G.G., Rasheed, A.M.A., Divergence between archival and perceptual measures of the environment: Causes and consequences (1993) The Academy of Management Review, 18, pp. 204-226; Brunner, S., Flachsland, C., Marschinski, R., Credible commitment in carbon policy (2011) Climate Policy, 12, pp. 255-271; Cagno, E., Trucco, P., Cleaner technology transfer in the Italian galvanic industry: Economic and know-how issues (2008) Journal of Cleaner Production, 16 (181), pp. 32-36; Cao, J., Garbaccio, R., Ho, M.S., China's 11th Five-Year Plan and the environment: Reducing SO2 emissions (2009) Review of Environmental Economics and Policy, 3, pp. 231-250; Chang, M.K., Predicting unethical behavior: A comparison of the theory of reasoned action and theory of planned behavior (1998) Journal of Business Ethics, 17, pp. 1825-1834; Clemens, B., Bamford, C.E., Douglas, T.J., Choosing strategic responses to address emerging environmental regulations: Size, perceived influence and uncertainty (2008) Business Strategy and the Environment, 17, pp. 493-511; Cordano, M., Frieze, I.H., Pollution reduction preferences of US environmental managers: Applying Ajzen's theory of planned behavior (2000) The Academy of Management Journal, 43, pp. 627-641; Corral, C.M., Sustainable production and consumption systems-cooperation for change: Assessing and simulating the willingness of the firm to adopt/develop cleaner technologies.

This model combines Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) with concepts of Fuzzy Set Theory and Nash Bargaining Game. The model permits an evaluation of the productive and economic efficiency of products, which may result in a portfolio of more profitable products with greater consumer market interest. The model was applied at an energy company. The results obtained applying the FDG model adhered to the reality of the studied company and provided goals for reducing resource levels (inputs) needed for manufacturing products and for increasing result levels (output) stemming from their commercialization. As an important additional outcome, the FDG model permitted the identification of portfolio products that are more sensitive to the occurrence of uncertainty. © RAE.","Bargaining games; Data envelopment analysis; Fuzzy set theory; Production strategies; Uncertainty",,"Aouni, B., Martel, J-M., Hassaine, A., Fuzzy Goal Programming model: an overview of the current state-of-the-art (2009) Journal of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis, 16 (5-6), pp. 149-161; (2010), http://www.bndes.gov.br/SiteBNDES/export/sites/default/bndes_pt/Galerias/Arquivos/produtos/download/Circ011_10.pdf, Circular n. 11/2010.

It does so by utilizing neo-institutional theory as an instrument for analysis, with an emphasis on outlining the coercive, mimetic, and normative pressures RNGOs face. One of the key findings of the study is that there is creative circumvention of isomorphic pressures by working with local agents, fostering trust with the local government, and keeping a low profile. Moreover, RNGOs dealt with the uncertain institutional environment in China through staff exchanges, denominational supervision, tapping into global platforms, and undergoing a professionalization process. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","China; isomorphism; neo-institutional theory; NGOs; religion",,"Berger, J., Religious nongovernmental organizations: An exploratory analysis (2003) Voluntas: International Journal of Voluntary and Nonprofit Organizations, 14 (1), pp. 15-39; Chan, S., Cross-cultural civility in global civil society: Transnational cooperation in Chinese NGOs (2008) Global Networks, 8 (2), pp. 232-252; Clarke, G., Faith matters: Faith-based organisations, civil society and international development (2006) Journal of International Development, 18, pp. 835-848; Deng, G., The hidden rules of governing China's unregistered NGOs: Management and consequences (2010) The China Review, 10 (1), pp. 183-206; Deng, G., Shieh, S., An emerging civil society: The impact of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake on grassroots associations in China (2011) The China Journal, 65, pp. 181-194; DiMaggio, P.J., Powell, W.W., The iron cage revisited: Institutional isomorphism and collective rationality in organizational fields (1983) American Sociological Review, 48 (2), pp. 147-160; (2011), Notice of ‘Suggestions for doing a good job of resisting foreign use of religion to infiltrate institutes of higher education and preventing campus evangelism’ (Document No. 18)Hasmath, R., (2010) A comparative study of minority development in China and Canada, , New York, NY: Palgrave Macmillan; Hasmath, R., Hsu, J., NGOs in China: Issues of good governance and accountability (2008) Asia Pacific Journal of Public Administration, 30 (1), pp. 1-11; Hasmath, R., Hsu, J., Isomorphic pressures, epistemic communities and state-NGO collaboration in China (2014) The China Quarterly, 220, pp. 936-954; Hasmath, R., Hsu, J., (2015) NGO governance and management in China, , New York, NY: Routledge; Hasmath, R., Hsu, J., (2015), Communities of practice and the NGO sector in China.

Design/methodology/approach: The procurement model is solved by using dynamic programming. First, we maximize the DM’s utility of the second period, obtaining the optimal contract quantity and spot quantity for the second period. Then, maximize the DM’s utility of both periods, obtaining the optimal purchasing strategy for the first period. We use a numerical method to compare the performance level of a pure spot sourcing strategy with that of a mixed strategy. Findings: Our results show that optimal purchasing strategies vary with the trend of contract prices. If the contract price falls, the total quantity purchased in period 1 will decrease in the degree of risk aversion. If the contract price increases, the total quantity purchased in period 1 will increase in the degree of risk aversion. In period 2, the relationship between the optimal contract quantity and the degree of risk aversion depends on whether the expected spot price or the contract price is larger. Finally, we compare the performance levels between a combined strategy and a spot sourcing strategy. It shows that a combined strategy is optimal for a riskaverse buyer. Originality/value: It’s challenging to deal with a two-period procurement problem with risk consideration. We have obtained results of a two-period procurement problem with two sourcing options, namely contract procurement and spot purchases. Our model incorporates the buyer’s risk aversion factor and the change of contract prices, which are not addressed in early studies. © 2015, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya.

Design/methodology/approach: In China, a survey was administered to managers of SMEs in Shanghai and Guangzhou. In the USA, a survey was administered to managers of SMEs in three major cities. Competitive strategy, capabilities, uncertainty, and performance were measured by previously validated scales. Findings: Findings support the integrity Miles and Snow generic strategic typology. Performance satisfaction was significantly lower in firms employing a reactor strategy as opposed to those employing prospector, defender, or analyzer strategies. Additional support was found for the concept of strategic clarity, as businesses reporting moderate strategic clarity had lower levels of satisfaction with performance than those reporting either a single strategy or a combination emphasis on three equal strategies. Practical implications: Chinese SMEs tend to prefer cost-based approaches to their local markets. A differentiation market approach is challenging in most local Chinese economies due to the low wages of most jobs in an economy that is still largely centrally planned. In the USA, more disposable income leads to more market opportunities. While this situation is gradually changing in China, it is not at a point where SMEs feel comfortable pursuing totally differentiated strategies. Originality/value: Several distinctions in competitive strategy, capabilities, and environmental uncertainty between China and the USA are recognized by analysis. Analyzers and defenders in Chinese SMEs tend to follow industry prospectors with lower prices and/or superior service. They might change strategies after gaining a foothold in the market. Performance for SMEs with low strategic clarity often depends on established guanxi with governmental agencies or stated-owned enterprises, a situation very different from that in the USA. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Capabilities; China; Competitive strategy; Environment uncertainty; SMEs",,"Aguilar, F., (1967) Scanning the Business Environment, , MacMillan, New York, NY; Allen, R.S., Helms, M.M., Linking strategic practices and organizational performance to Porter's generic strategies (2006) Business Process Management Journal, 12, pp. 433-454; Assudani, R.H., What does it mean to management 'knowledge': Implications for the strategic management of knowledge in firms (2008) International Journal of Management & Decision Making, 9, pp. 646-659; Ayadi, O.G., Dufrene, U.B., Obi, C.P., Firm performance measurement: Temporal roadblock to innovation?

The author argues that product sameness amongst many high street womenswear retailers in the UK is a deliberate strategy employed by industry practitioners to limit demand uncertainty. Based on an empirical study of UK high street womenswear retailers, the author argues that the womenswear fashion industry, like other industries operating in markets faced by high levels of demand uncertainty, has adopted strategies to minimise economic risks. The author explores how fashion information created by companies/groups in the quaternary industry sector is used as inspirational sources for fashion workers at retailing level and contributes to the development of a collective taste amongst them. Collective taste in the context of this research is seen not as a by-product of interaction as theorised by Blumer, but as a strategy to cope with the inherent demand uncertainty experienced by firms operating in the womenswear market and as a means for establishing some orderliness in the fashion system. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",,,"Aspers, P., Contextual Knowledge (2006) Current Sociology, 54 (5), pp. 745-763; Blumer, H., Fashion: From Class Differentiation to Collective Selection (1969) The Sociological Quarterly, 10, pp. 275-291; Bourdieu, P., (1984) Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste, , London: Routledge & Kegan Paul; Bourdieu, P., Delsaut, W.Y., Le Couturier et sa Griffe: Contribution á une Théorie de la Magie (1975) Actes De La Recherche En Sciences Sociales, 1 (1), pp. 7-36; Braham, P., Fashion: Unpacking a Cultural Production (1997) Production of Culture/Cultures of Production, pp. 121-165. , edited by Paul du Gay, London: Sage; Caves, R., (2000) Creative Industries: Contracts between Art and Commerce, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; (2014) About Color Marketing Group., , http://www.colormarketing.org/about-cmg, Accessed June 13; Costantino, M., (1998) Fashion Marketing and PR, , London: BT Batsford; Crane, D., (1992) The Production of Culture: Media and the Urban Arts, , Cambridge, MA: Sage; Davis, F., Herbert Blumer and the Study of Fashion - a Reminiscence and a Critique (1991) Symbolic Interaction, 14 (1), pp. 1-21; Davis, F., (1992) Fashion, Culture, and Identity, , Chicago, IL: The University of Chicago Press; Dempster, A.M., (2005) Entrepreneurial Reactions to Uncertainty in the Creative Industries., pp. 22-23. , Paper presented at the Conference on The Creative Industries and Intellectual Property, London, May; Dempster, A.M., Managing Uncertainty in Creative Industries (2006) Creativity and Innovation Management, 15 (3), pp. 224-233; De, V., (2004) Hollywood Economics: How Extreme Uncertainty Shapes the Film Industry, , London: Routledge; Entwistle, J., (2009) The Aesthetic Economy of Fashion: Markets and Value in Clothing and Modelling, , New York: Berg; Ewing, E., (1997) History of Twentieth Century Fashion, , 3rd ed.

This article explores whether and how the concept of security is changing due to this ‘rise of risk’, through a hermeneutically grounded conceptual and discourse analysis of the United Kingdom government’s National Security Strategy (NSS) from 1998 to 2011. We ask how risk-security language is employed in the NSS; what factors motivate such discursive shifts; and what, if any, consequences of these shifts can be discerned in UK national security practices. Our aim is twofold: to better understand shifts in the security understandings and policies of UK authorities; and to contribute to the conceptual debate on the significance of the rise of risk as a component of the concept of security. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.","Concept of security; national security strategy; risk; securitisation; threat; UK",,"Aradau, C., Van Munster, R., Governing terrorism through risk: Taking precautions, (un)knowing the future (2007) European Journal of International Relations, 13 (1), pp. 89-115; Aradau, C., Lobo-Guerrero, L., Van Munster, R., Security, technologies of risk, and the political: Guest editors’ introduction (2008) Security Dialogue, 39 (2-3), pp. 147-154; Beck, U., (1992) Risk Society: Towards a New Modernity, , London: Sage; Beck, U., (1999) World Risk Society, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Beckett, M., Margaret Beckett on climate change.

In this study, a stochastic fractional transportation-energy system planning model (SFP-LR) is developed for identification of sustainable system management strategies under uncertainties. Based on a hybrid of stochastic programming and fractional programming techniques, the proposed method can systematically reflect multiple complexities in such a management system. It can not only optimize the transportation energy consumption represented as output/input ratios, but also handle imprecise uncertainties in terms of left-hand-side random variables for examining the reliability of satisfying the constraints. The SFP-LR model is applied to support regional transportation-energy planning for demonstrating effectiveness of the developed approach. The solutions obtained from the SFP-LR approach can provide optimal transportation system planning schemes for regional CO2 emission control towards sustainable management under multiple complexities. It is also indicated that transport structure and management measures have important impacts on transportation energy consumption. © ASCE.","CO2 emission; energy; management; policy; transportation; uncertainties","Carbon dioxide;

The proposed approach applies to settings in which unmet demand is backordered or lost; and it can accommodate variants of the problem for which the quality of service is captured by means of backorder penalty costs, non-stockout probabilities, or fill rate constraints. This approach has a number of advantages with respect to existing methods in the literature: it enables seamless modelling of different variants of the stochastic lot sizing problem, some of which have been previously tackled via ad hoc solution methods and some others that have not yet been addressed in the literature; and it produces an accurate estimation of the expected total cost, expressed in terms of upper and lower bounds based on piecewise linearisation of the first order loss function. We illustrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed approach by means of a computational study. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Fill rate; First order loss function; Non-stockout probability; Penalty cost; Piecewise linearisation; Static-dynamic uncertainty; Stochastic lot sizing",,"Wagner, H.M., Whitin, T.M., Dynamic version of the economic lot size model (1958) Management Science, 5, pp. 89-96; Bookbinder, J.H., Tan, J.Y., Strategies for the probabilistic lot-sizing problem with service-level constraints (1988) Management Science, 34, pp. 1096-1108; Scarf, H.E., Optimality of (s, S) policies in the dynamic inventory problem (1960) Mathematical methods in the social sciences, pp. 196-202. , Stanford University Press, Stanford, CA, K.J.

A primary function of strategic traffic management is the development of traffic management initiatives to mitigate potential large-scale congestion. However, the associated longer planning horizon-2-24 hours in advance of anticipated problems-means that congestion forecasts are highly uncertain. Furthermore, complex interactions exist between management initiatives and traffic propagation, producing a non-intuitive planning environment. The proposed adaptive planning framework captures these features, enabling quantitative design of traffic management initiatives that balance uncertainty with performance. Specifically, a decision tree is constructed to represent critical deviations in the forecast over the planning horizon. Corresponding decision points provide opportunities for management initiatives to be defined, and a genetic algorithm is employed to optimize the expected performance of the initiatives over the entire decision tree. Thus, this method identifies optimal strategies under forecast uncertainty, capturing the tradeoff between employing initiatives that may not be required and lost opportunities due to inaction. Performance of the adaptive design framework is compared with alternate design approaches, verifying the potential value of this new approach for real time decision making.","Congestion Mitigation; Decision Support;

However, findings within this important research field and, consequently, implications for practice remain contradictory and confusing. The purpose of this paper is to examine determinants of an international marketing-mix strategy within a specific business-to-business context that includes the effects of uncertainty. Is the degree to which the marketing program is adapted or standardized dependent on the managerial perception of uncertainty? Does a firm's international entrepreneurial ability or the use of networks positively influence the degree of positive assessment of the environment? Data were collected from German companies working in different international business-to-business markets. The results indicate that international entrepreneurship has a greater impact on uncertainty reduction than the use of networks. After having reduced uncertainty, a firm tends to adapt their communication and pricing strategy, whereas the adaptation of the product and distribution strategy in general is not significant. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Adaptation; Business-to-business; Globalization; Industrial goods; International marketing strategy; Marketing mix; Standardization; Uncertainty",,"Agarwal, S., Ramaswami, S.N., Choice of foreign market entry mode: Impact of ownership, location, and internalization factors (1992) Journal of International Business Studies, 23 (1), pp. 1-27; Albadvi, A., Hosseini, M., Mapping B2B value exchange in marketing relationships: A systematic approach (2011) Journal of Business & Industrial Marketing, 26 (7), pp. 503-513; Aldrich, H., (1979) Organizations and environments, , Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ; Backhaus, K., Muehlfeld, K., Strategy dynamics in industrial marketing: A business types perspective (2005) Management Decision, 43 (1), pp. 38-55; (2004) Handbuch Industriegütermarketing: Strategien, Instrumente, Anwendungen, , Wiesbaden, Gabler, K.

At the same time, the scientific community has sought to improve its communication practices, in order to present a more accurate picture to the public and policy makers of the state of scientific knowledge about climate change. In this review article, we examine two sets of insights that could influence the success of such communication efforts. The first set questions which uncertainties matter for effective climate policy. While the literature has focused disproportionately on uncertainties with respect to the climate system, we draw attention here to uncertainties associated with the solution space. The second set examines which factors lead people to take slow and deliberated decisions versus quick and spontaneous ones, and looks at the results of these two systems of thought on climate change action. From the review of these two sets of literature, we propose a new hypothesis: that the gap between public and scientific attitudes toward climate change will narrow not because of greater attention to and communication of climate system risks and uncertainties, but rather out of growing experience with the policies and technological systems needed to address the problem. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,"climate change; communication; environmental policy; perception; policy making; risk assessment; uncertainty analysis","Shulman, S., (2007) Smoke, Mirrors and Hot Air: How ExxonMobil Uses Big Tobacco's Tactics to Manufacture Uncertainty on Climate Science, , Cambridge, MA: Union of Concerned Scientists; ; Mastrandrea, M., Field, C., Stocker, T.F., Edenhofer, O., Ebi, K.L., Frame, D.J., Held, H., Matschos, P., (2010) Guidance Note for Lead Authors of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report on Consistent Treatment of Uncertainties, , Geneva: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; ; Manning, M., Petit, M., Easterling, D., Murphy, J., Patwardhan, A., Rogner, H.H., Swart, R., Yohe, G., (2004) Workshop Report: IPCC Workshop on Describing Scientific Uncertainties in Climate Change to Support Analysis of Risk and of Options, , Boulder: IPCC Working Group I Technical Support Unit; ; Moss, R., Schneider, S., Uncertainties in the IPCC TAR: Recommendations to Lead Authors for More Consistent Assessment and Reporting (2000) IPCC Supporting Material, Guidance Papers on the Corss Cutting Issues of the Third Assessment Report of the IPCC, pp. 33-51. , In: Pachauri R, Taniguchi T, Tanaka K, eds.

The performance measures in PMS which have mainly concentrated on the financial dimension, are insufficient for today's competitive business environment to gauge the firm's success. As a result a firm incorporates non-financial measures to supplement the financial measures. Research work has been widely focused on variables that influence both the financial and non-financial performance measures and provided valuable information for the firm's strategic direction. Among the variables, the business strategy, environmental uncertainty and market position have some influence on performance measures. This study empirically explores the influence of these three research variables on the financial dimension using the structural equation modelling (SEM) approach. The SEM analysis has revealed that among the three independent variables, only two variables have influence on the dependent financial performance measure dimension. However, on the whole, the standard regression weight of all three latent variables is not very strong, indicating that other elements are influencing the financial dimension. A future study is recommended using a similar approach on other non-financial performance measures to identify the significance. © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Business strategy; Environmental uncertainty and market position;

The authors propose an investment decision-making process for future port infrastructure investments taking into account various uncertainties, which can impact the return of the investment over the project's useful life. The methodology has been applied on the expansion evaluation of warehousing facilities in a multipurpose port. For the evaluation of the alternatives, the expected net present value (ENPV) is based on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Results show that the investment strategy for a new 4-level warehouse with a flexible option was the optimal choice when compared with strategies of similar scale. However, depending on the emphasis placed on the various investment metrics the optimal investment strategy seems to be closer to a non-flexible 5-level warehouse. © 2014, The Korean Association of Shipping and Logistics, Inc.

Whilst there are various theoretical methods for decision making under uncertainty, they generally have not been applied to the water sector. Nor have they been brought together in an integrated, practically-grounded process to guide strategic planning and project level decisions, such as the approach proposed in this paper. This approach avoids predictions of the future or modelling intensive analysis, rather it integrates the fundamental characteristics of uncertain system influences (trends and shocks) with two additional thinking tools: The use of scenarios based on a number of uncertainties to describe potential futures, and the focus on investment approaches to guide the packaging of potential response measures.

Drawing on enactment and information-processing theories, this study views the external environment as a source of information (i.e. enacted) and organizations as information-processing entities. We propose a conceptual framework of antecedents and market performance consequences of emergent marketing strategies and test it with a sample of 214 UK enterprises. The results suggest that dimensions of market uncertainty (i.e. dynamism and complexity) and strategic feedback systems influence the formation of emergent marketing strategy. Furthermore, the data reveal that market uncertainty aspects condition the association between emergent marketing strategies and market performance in different ways.

Unlike other schedule-based models in the literature, we consider supply uncertainties and assume that users adopt strategies to travel from their origins to their destinations. We present an analytical formulation to ensure that on-board passengers continuing to the next stop have priority and waiting passengers are loaded on a first-come-first-serve basis. We propose an analytical model that captures the stochastic nature of the transit schedules and in-vehicle travel times due to road conditions, incidents, or adverse weather. We adopt a mean variance approach that can consider the covariance of travel time between links in a space-time graph but still lead to a robust transit network loading procedure when optimal strategies are adopted. The proposed model is formulated as a user equilibrium problem and solved by an MSA-type algorithm. Numerical results are reported to show the effects of supply uncertainties on the travel strategies and departure times of passengers. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Schedule-based transit assignment; Strategy; Supply uncertainty; User equilibrium","Stochastic systems; Travel time; Analytical formulation; Mean-variance approach; Optimal strategies; Stochastic nature; Strategy; Supply uncertainty; Transit assignment; User equilibrium; Loading; algorithm; analytical method; tourist destination; travel behavior; travel time; uncertainty analysis","Bartholdi, J.J., Eisenstein, D.D., A self-coördinating bus route to resist bus bunching (2012) Transportation Research Part B, 46 (4), pp. 481-491; Biswas, A., Song, P., Discrete-valued ARMA processes (2009) Statistical and Probability Letters, (79), pp. 1884-1889; Börjesson, M., Eliasson, J., Franklin, J.P., Valuations of travel time variability in scheduling versus mean-variance models (2012) Transportation Research Part B, 46 (7), pp. 855-873; Brockwell, P.J., Davis, R.A., (1991) Time Series: Theory and Methods, , Springer-Verlag, New York; Cantarella, G.E., A general fixed-point approach to multimode multi-user equilibrium assignment with elastic demand (1997) Transportation Science, 31 (2), pp. 107-128; Cascetta, E., Nuzzolo, A., Russo, F., Vitetta, A., A modified logit route choice model overcoming path overlapping problems: specification and some calibration results for interurban networks (1996) Transportation and Traffic Theory, pp. 697-711. , Pergamon, New York, J.B.

Lee (2002) proposed a framework to consider the impact of alignment between SC strategy and environmental uncertainty and its impact on SC performance. The purpose of this paper is to apply this framework in Iran and extend it using balanced scorecard (BSC) approach. Design/methodology/approach – A research survey was completed to consider the aim of this research. A total of 124 questionnaires were returned. Findings – The alignment between SC strategy and environmental uncertainty and its positive impact on SC performance has been proven (except for risk-hedging strategy). Efficient strategy enhances all the four BSC perspectives, while agile strategy only improves learning and growth perspective. Originality/value – This research extends the work of Lee (2002) and Sun et al. (2009) by emphasizing the impact of SC strategy on each of the four perspectives of BSC. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Balanced scorecard; Decision-making analysis; Environmental uncertainty; Performance; Supply chain management; Supply chain strategy",,"Acur, N., Englyst, L., Assessment of strategy formulation: How to ensure quality in process and outcome (2006) International Journal of Production Management, 26 (1), pp. 69-91; Ahn, T.K., Lee, K.Y., Kim, J.H., The conflict over separation of prescribing and dispensing practices in Korea: A bargaining perspective (2002) Korean Journal of Public Health and Administration, 12 (4); Avella, A., Saltiel, P., Bizzi, E., Combinations of muscle synergies in the construction of a natural motor behavior (2003) Nat.

Traffic flow dynamics under demand and supply uncertainties is described by a simplified version of the stochastic cell transmission model. Based on this model, the optimal traffic management problem is analysed wherein the existence of solution is guaranteed by verifying the well-posed condition. An analytical optimal control law is derived in terms of a set of coupled generalised recursive Riccati equations. As optimal control laws may be fragile with respect to model misspecification, a robust (optimal) decision-making law that aims to act robust with respect to the parameter misspecification in the traffic flow model (which can be originated from model calibration), and to attenuate the effect of disturbances in freeway networks (wherein demand uncertainty is usually regarded as a kind of disturbance) is proposed. Conventionally, network uncertainties have been considered to induce negative effects on traffic management in transportation literature. In contrast, the proposed methodology outlines an interesting issue that is to make benefit (or trade-off) from the inherent network uncertainties. Finally, some practical issues in traffic management that can be addressed by extending the current framework are briefly discussed. © 2014 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies Limited.","approximate dynamic programming; dynamic pricing; optimal traffic management; ramp metering; robustness; stochastic dynamic programming","Control; Control theory; Decision making; Riccati equations; Robustness (control systems); Stochastic systems; Approximate dynamic programming; Dynamic pricing; Ramp metering; Stochastic dynamic programming; Traffic management; Highway traffic control","Aboudolas, K., Papageorgiou, M., Kosmatopoulos, E., Store-and-Forward Based Methods for the Signal Control Problem in Large-Scale Congested Urban Road Networks (2009) Transportation Research Part C, 17 (2), pp. 163-174; Aboudolas, K., Papageorgiou, M., Kouvelas, A., Kosmatopoulos, E., A Rolling-Horizon Quadratic-Programming Approach to the Signal Control Problem in Large-Scale Congested Urban Road Networks (2010) Transportation Research Part C, 18 (5), pp. 680-694; Adler, J., Satapathy, G., Manikonda, V., Bowles, B., Blue, V., A Multi-Agent Approach to Cooperative Traffic Management and Route Guidance (2005) Transportation Research Part B, 39 (4), pp. 297-318; Ait Rami, M., Chen, X., Zhou, X., Discrete-Time Indefinite LQ Control with State and Control Dependent Noises (2002) Journal of Global Optimization, 23 (3-4), pp. 245-265; Ait Rami, M., Zhou, X., Linear Matrix Inequalities, Riccati Equations, and Indefinite Stochastic Linear Quadratic Controls (2000) IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 45 (6), pp. 1131-1143; Anderson, B., Moore, J., (1979) Optimal Filtering, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ, Englewood Cliffs, NJ,: Prentice-Hall; Basar, T., Bernhard, P., (1995) H∞ Optimal Control and Related Minimax Design Problems, , Basel, Basel,: Birkhauser; Bertsekas, D., (2007) Dynamic Programming and Optimal Control, 2. , 3rd ed., Belmont, MA, Belmont, MA,: Athena Scientific; Blandin, S., Couque, A., Bayenc, A., Work, D., On Sequential Data Assimilation for Scalar Macroscopic Traffic Flow Models (2012) Physica D, 241 (17), pp. 1421-1440; Boyd, S., Ghaoui, L., Feron, E., Balakrishnan, V., (1994) Linear Matrix Inequalities in System and Control Theory, , Philadelphia, Philadelphia,: Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics; Cai, C., Wong, C., Heydecker, B., Adaptive Traffic Signal Control using Approximate Dynamic Programming (2009) Transportation Research Part C, 17 (5), pp. 456-474; Carlson, R., Papamichail, I., Papageorgiou, M., Messmer, A., Optimal Motorway Traffic Flow Control Involving Variable Speed Limits and Ramp Metering (2010) Transportation Science, 44 (2), pp. 238-253; Carlson, R., Papamichail, I., Papageorgiou, M., Local Feedback-based Mainstream Traffic Flow Control on Motorways Using Variable Speed Limits (2011) IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 12 (4), pp. 1261-1276; Chen, B., Cheng, H., A Review of the Applications of Agent Technology in Traffic and Transportation Systems (2010) IEEE Transaction on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 11 (2), pp. 485-497; Chen, B., Cheng, H., Palen, J., Integrating Mobile Agent Technology with Multi-agent Systems for Distributed Traffic Detection and Management Systems (2009) Transportation Research Part C, 17 (1), pp. 1-10; Chen, S., Zhou, X., Stochastic Linear Quadratic Regulators with Indefinite Control Weight Costs (1998) SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization, 36 (5), pp. 1685-1702; Chen, S., Zhou, X., Stochastic Linear Quadratic Regulators with Indefinite Control Weight Costs.

Simulating everyday choice, participants made successive retailer choices where on each occasion they chose a retailer and only then learned product prices. The results of a series of studies demonstrated that participants were more likely to choose a retailer that offered an everyday low pricing strategy (EDLP) or that offered frequent small discounts over a retailer that offered infrequent large discounts. This choice advantage for the retailer that was cheaper more often manifested even when its average price was judged to be higher. The same results were obtained when choices were made a day apart, when price feedback was only given for the chosen retailer, and when price feedback was given for both retailers. Participant’s expectations of future prices but not their judgments of retailer’s past average prices predicted their subsequent retailer choice. © 2014 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc.",,,"Abdellaoui, M., L’haridon, O., Paraschiv, C., Experienced versus Described Uncertainty: Do We Need Two Prospect Theory Specifications?

I outline the aims and results of the reforms and their evaluation by international and local experts, and confront their opinions with assessments made by the ""ordinary"" people. In my view, an apparent discrepancy between the official and popular views is due mainly to uncertainty and anxiety related to political instability and economic difficulties of the country, paired with general distrust in medical institutions and, particularly, in professional and moral standards of doctors. Corruption, greed and incompetence of physicians are mentioned among the causes that make therapeutic encounters risky. Such common approach leads to the often observed ""doctor-avoiding strategies"" and contributes to the increase in popularity of complementary medicine. I discuss some tactics and strategies employed by the people when coping with health problems in those circumstances. As I argue, despite some evident success in reforming health care system, it is important both to recognize its faults and deficiencies, and to take into account emotional factors that significantly shape people's choices.","Bishkek; Health-seeking strategies; Kyrgyzstan; Post-Soviet central Asia; Reforms of health care system; Risk; Trust; Uncertainty",,"Aronson, P., Rejecting professional medicine in contemporary Russia, Vestnik (2007) The Journal of Russian and Asian Studies, (6). , http://www.sras.org/rejecting_professional_medi-cine_in_contemporary_russia, 5.06.2013; Baschieri, A., Falkingham, J., Formalizing informal payments: The progress of health reform in Kyrgyzstan (2006) Central Asian Survey, 25 (4), pp. 441-460; Borowitz, M., Reinverting the pyramid: Reforming primary health care in NIS health systems (1995) Vital Signs, (2), pp. 1-4. , 10; Borowitz, M., Atun, R., The unfinished journey from semashko to bismarck: Health reform in central Asia from 1991 to 2006 (2006) Central Asian Survey, 25 (4), pp. 419-440; Csordas, J.T., (1997) The Sacred Self, a Cultural Phenomenology of Charismatic Healing, , University of California Press, Berkeley-Los Angeles; Desmond, N., Prost, A., Wight, D., Managing risk through treatment-seeking in rural north-western Tanzania: Categorising health problems as malaria and nzoka (2012) Health, Risk and Society, 14 (2), pp. 149-170; Douglas, M., Risk as a forensic resource (1990) Daedalus, 119 (4), pp. 1-16; Falkingham, J., Akkazieva, B., Baschieri, A., Trends in out- -of-pocket payments for health care in Kyrgyzstan, 2001-2007 (2010) Health Policy and Planning, 25 (5), pp. 427-436; Field, M.G., The Soviet legacy: The past as a prologue (2002) Health Care in Central Asia, pp. 67-75. , [w:], red.

This study examines how a social networking site is used for information seeking about a potential or current romantic partner. In a survey, Facebook users (N=517) were presented with Facebook behaviors categorized as passive (e.g., reading a partner's profile), active (e.g., ""friending"" a common third party), or interactive (e.g., commenting on the partner's wall) uncertainty reduction strategies. Participants reported how normative they perceived these behaviors to be during four possible stages of relationship development (before meeting face-to-face, after meeting face-to-face, casual dating, and exclusive dating). Results indicated that as relationships progress, perceived norms for these behaviors change. Sex differences were also observed, as women perceived passive and interactive strategies as more normative than men during certain relationship stages. © 2014 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,"adolescent; adult; female; gender identity; human; human relation; information processing; information seeking; male; marriage; middle aged; perception; psychology; sexuality; social media; social network; social psychology; uncertainty; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Data Collection; Female; Gender Identity; Humans; Information Seeking Behavior; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Marriage; Middle Aged; Sexual Partners; Social Conformity; Social Media; Social Networking; Social Perception; Uncertainty; Young Adult","Stafford, L., Hillyer, J.D., Information and communication technologies in personal relationships (2012) Review of Communication, 12, pp. 290-312; http://newsroom.fb.com/company-info, Facebook.

Technology investment enables a firm to reduce its total production cost, while flexible capacity strategy aims to reduce a firms production waste by postponing production until demand is known. Adopting a general technology investment cost, we examine how technology investment cost structure affects a firms technology investment decisions. We derive the conditions under which the firm will benefit from technology investment. We show that the firm can increase its expected profit through technology investment only when the unit technology investment cost that varies inversely with the basic technology level is below a threshold. However, even though the technology investment cost is zero, the benefit from the increase in technology level is limited. Furthermore, we analytically determine the optimal technology levels and establish their relationships under different technology investment cost structures. Our findings will help firms evaluate various technology investment options and choose the most proper one. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Demand uncertainty; Flexible capacity strategy; Technology investment","Costs; Industry; Investments; Demand uncertainty; Expected profits; Flexible capacity; Optimal technology; Production wastes; Technology investments; Total production cost; Various technologies; Technology","Anand, K.S., Girotra, K., The strategic perils of delayed differentiation (2007) Manage.

The study aims to show principally how the defence attorney of the accused exploits the hedging strategies of the female victim-witness in order to discredit her testimony and thereby win the case for the defence. By so doing, the argumentation will make two theoretical points. The first point is disciplinary, in that it will demonstrate the powerful contribution of the language sciences to the identification and unveiling of social injustice. The second point is ideological, in that it will show how some areas of Anglo-American institutions continue to reflect a social tendency towards leniency in the face of violence against women. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Critical discourse analysis; Gender; Hedging; Judicial discourse; Rape trials",,"(2012) Rape Survivors Open up about their Experiences, , http//:www.BBCNews-RapeSurvivorsOpenUpAboutTheirExperiences.htm, BBC News.

Six longitudinal case studies reveal two approaches to business model development: focused commitment and simultaneous experimentation. While focused commitment positively affects initial growth, this commitment and lack of variety jeopardize long-term survival. Simultaneous experimentation implies lower initial growth levels, but facilitates long-term survival by enacting variety in a resource-effective manner. This article enriches organizational learning theory by demonstrating that not only distant search but also simultaneous experimentation results in variety. Moreover, simultaneous experimentation implies effectual behavior and reconciles the apparent juxtaposition between 'action' and 'planning.'

The hotel sector in Turkey's hospitality industry is investigated. Generic strategies were self-reported with regard to typologies develop by Porter, and Miles and Snow. Partial support was found for direct linkages between environmental uncertainty and both financial and non-financial performance. Defenders exhibited the highest value in competitive uncertainty, but the difference was not significant. Prospectors, analyzers, and defenders outperformed reactors in terms of both financial and non-financial performance. Overall, defender/cost leadership and prospector/focus strategies appear to be the best options for Turkish hotels. Following Porter's admonition, hotels in Turkey seeking to combine low cost and differentiation approaches are likely to end up ""stuck in the middle.""

The present article criticizes the logic of such corporate restrictions. Data obtained from 164 pharmaceutical firms operating in 27 different countries support the positive implications of inclusive and collaborative human resources practices. Our results reveal positive and significant relationships between the practices of information sharing with employees and promoting employee collaboration and the development of a proactive natural environmental strategy for a firm. In addition, this research tests the moderating role of general environment uncertainty in these relationships.

Moderate support was found for links between the defender strategy and competitive uncertainty, the prospector strategy and technology uncertainty, and the analyzer strategy and market uncertainty. In all three nations, businesses with high and low strategic clarity-the extent to which a single generic strategy reflects the organization's strategic intent-outperformed those with moderate strategic clarity.

Despite the simple definition of cut-off grade, the COGS problem is one of the complex and complicated problems in the mine planning process. From the optimization point of view, the COGS with an objective of maximizing the present value of future cash flows is a non-linear and a non-convex problem that even in its deterministic form can be solved using approximate optimization methods. This optimization problem will also be more complex and complicated under uncertainty conditions. This paper proposes an uncertainty based multi-criteria ranking system to investigate the problem of COGS selection considering metal price and geological uncertainties. The proposed system aims at selection of the best COGS among technically feasible alternative COGSs under uncertainty circumstances. Our developed system is based on integrating metal price and geological uncertainties as well as operating flexibility to close the mine early. We incorporate this operating flexibility into the proposed system using a Monte Carlo based real options (RO) valuation model. For this purpose, in addition to the expected value, other risk criteria are considered to rank the alternatives. These risk criteria include abilities of strategies in producing extra profits, minimizing losses, and achieving the predefined goals of the production. In this study, the technically possible COGSs are generated using the Lane comprehensive algorithm. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, we utilize data of an Iranian gold mine. Results show that the proposed system outperforms conventional methods in the sense that it shows significantly lower average mis-ranking than the other methods and also selects a strategy with a higher value. The sensitivity analysis of the proposed system relative to the gold price shows that the system is highly dependent on the parameters of the stochastic process used to model the evolution of the metal price. Therefore, special consideration should be given in estimating stochastic process parameters. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

It provides users a place to communicate, to solve problems and to exchange information with each other on an online trading platform which faced a bilateral market-seller and buyer participants. Beginning with the incentive strategy, this paper studies the influence of material and spiritual incentive strategies on online trading platform. In addition, the authors take bilateral market uncertainty as a moderator into consideration. By doing an empirical research of hard data from a representative domestic online trading platform, the result shows us that: 1 both material and spiritual incentive strategies have significant effects on improving the community user loyalty 2 both material and spiritual incentive strategies are almost equally beneficial in high seller user uncertainty; while spiritual incentive is more useful in high buyer user uncertainty.

In principle, one strategy could use variable air volume (VAV). However, VAV boxes are often set to deliver constant air volume (CAV), perhaps due to a lack of confidence in the controllability of the VAV.In this paper, an adaptive VAV operation is introduced in response to a concern that the current operation is not adequate, as it leads to excessive fan energy consumption. The adaptive VAV temporarily increases the volume offset before the door is opened, and thus induces a higher negative pressure differential. Otherwise the negative pressure differential is kept at an acceptable minimum.This paper evaluates the current practice of the VAV being set to CAV in comparison to the adaptive VAV operation, which will help the facility manager make a decision. A rationale of ventilation operation is chosen by a set of objective performance evaluation criteria: normalized energy consumption, potential exposure to contamination, and thermal comfort. Analysis results show that the two operation modes do not exhibit noticeable differences in their ability to control the spread of contaminants or in their maintenance of thermal comfort. However, the adaptive VAV mode consumes significantly less energy.As transitioning between low and high pressure differentials of the adaptive VAV may result in momentary contamination exposure, caregivers can be asked to pause at the door until the required negative pressure differential is achieved in order to secure a safe transition. As this new process requires a change of the protocol for caregivers in isolation rooms, an additional performance aspect concerning potential loss of care time is incorporated into the decision analysis.A Bayesian decision theory is applied to support multi-criteria decision-making. A decision model is developed that considers stakeholders' different preferences for performance, and risk attitudes are compiled in terms of utility. Case studies emphasize that the ultimate decision should be reached based on multi-criteria comparisons of building environmental and organizational outcomes in a multidimensional and comprehensive manner. Due to the uncertainty of the performance model and the decision model, however, the choosing the decision model without accounting for uncertainty may not be always warranted; in particular, when utilities of decision options do not exhibit significant differences over the utility of the chosen decision option. Besides uncertainty analysis, this study also emphasizes an importance of significant difference testing for decision alternatives as key supplemental measures for the decision support framework under uncertainty. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Building performance; Decision support; Isolation room; Significant difference test; Uncertainty analysis; Variable air volume","Building performance; Decision supports; Isolation room; Significant difference test; Variable air volume; Decision making; Decision support systems; Energy utilization; Hospitals; Managers; Models; Thermal comfort; Uncertainty analysis; Doors; Bayesian analysis; decision support system; energy use; hospital sector; performance assessment; stakeholder; uncertainty analysis; ventilation; Chicken anemia virus","(2003) ASHRAE HVAC design manual for hospitals and clinics, , ASHRAE, Atlanta, GA, ASHRAE; (1994) Guidelines for preventing the transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in healthcare facilities, , CDC, Atlanta, GA, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; (2006) VA HVAC design manual for healthcare, , Department of Veteran Affairs, Richmond VA, Department of Veteran Affairs; (2001) Guidelines for design and construction of hospital and health care facilities, , AIA, Washington, D.C., AIA; Van Den Brink, A., van Schijndel, A., Improved control of the pressure in a cleanroom environment (2012) Building Simulation, 5 (1), pp. 61-72; Balocco, C., Petrone, G., Cammarata, G., Assessing the effects of sliding doors on an operating theatre climate (2012) Building Simulation, 5 (1), pp. 73-83; Howard Ronald, A., Decision analysis: applied decision theory (1966) Proceedings of the 4th International conference on operational research, pp. 55-77; de Wilde, P., Voorde, M., Providing computational support for the selection of energy saving building components (2004) Energ Build, 36, pp. 749-758; de Wit, M.S., Uncertainty in predictions of thermal comfort in buildings (2001), Delft, TU Delft.

Therewith, it provides further understanding of performance of regional planning beyond the formality of plans and policies. The case studies illustrate how planners' actions can either generate uncertainty, conflicts and frustration, or common understanding, agreements and positive expectations. With these insights, planners can be more conscious about the effects of their communicative strategies on the multiple perceptions of the planning process. Planners need to deal with interpretations of other actors, and they have to be aware of others' expectations and uncertainties. The positive effect of interactions has limitations because of the unavoidable existence of different perceptions and interests concerning a plan. Nevertheless, planners can generate even greater conflicts themselves if the perceptions from other stakeholders are ignored. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,"performance assessment; regional planning; regional policy; stakeholder; uncertainty analysis; Catalonia; Pyrenees; Spain","Abbott, J., Understanding and managing the unknown: The nature of uncertainty in planning (2005) Journal of Planning Education and Research, 24 (3), pp. 237-251. , doi:10.1177/0739456X04267710; Albrechts, L., Mandelbaum, S.J., (2005) The Network Society: A New Context for Planning?, , London, London,: Routledge; Alfama, E., Casademunt, A., Coll-Planas, G., Cruz, H., Martí, M., (2007) Per una nova cultura del territori?

The strategy is based on an extended version of the real options approach to repeated replacement decisions, in which the goal is to determine the operating cost and delivery lead-time conditions upon which a replacement should be ordered. The real options approach to capital replacement problems is superior to traditional net present value (NPV) approaches, as it values of the option to adapt decisions based on current (rather than predicted) system conditions. However, previous applications of the real options approach to repeated replacement have not considered the impact of long and uncertain lead times, and have therefore focused on when to replace rather than when to order. Delivery lead times are an important consideration in an expanding mining sector in which demand for heavy mobile equipment (HME) exceeds the capacity of suppliers to provide the equipment in a timely manner. The inclusion of a lead time element results in a decision with an option period and an option-less period. Simulations are used to demonstrate the improved outcome of real options based replacement strategies compared with those derived using a traditional NPV approach, both with and without lead times. Further the performance of the order placement strategy with different boundary conditions, bounded and reflecting, is explored. No appreciable difference in performance of these strategies was identified. The optimal order placement strategy incorporating delivery lead times is displayed on a simple chart which is accessible to fleet management personnel. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Lead time; Optimisation; Real options; Replacement","Asset replacement; Delivery lead time; Different boundary condition; Extended versions; Fleet management; Leadtime; Mining sector; Mobile equipments; Net present value; On currents; Optimisations; Placement strategy; Real Options; Real options approach; Replacement; Replacement strategy; System conditions; Equipment; Fleet operations; Human resource management; Optimization; Distribution of goods","Adkins, R., (2005) Real Options Analysis of Capital Equipment Replacement under Revenue Uncertainty, , Working Paper, 106.

The findings of our longitudinal experiment reemphasize the importance of continuous pioneering, demonstrating that consumers exhibit a strong preference for a previous generation pioneer's product when it continues to pioneer the successive generation. More importantly, the findings indicate that continuous pioneering with a new brand leads to greater brand preferences when technological uncertainty is high. This is because in that condition, consumers perceive greater innovativeness with a new brand than with the extant one. On the other hand, an extant brand increases consumer brand preferences for a previous generation pioneer's product in the successive generation when technological uncertainty is low. The theoretical and practical implications of the results for understanding and managing pioneering advantage and brand strategy in the multigenerational product markets are discussed. © 2012 Product Development & Management Association.",,"Brand strategy; Innovativeness; Multigenerational products; Technological uncertainty; Innovation; Management; Commerce","Aaker, D.A., Keller, K.L., Consumer evaluations of brand extensions (1990) Journal of Marketing, 54, pp. 27-41. , JANUARY; Alpert, F., Kamins, M., Sakano, T., Onzo, N., Graham, J., Retail buyer beliefs, attitude, and behavior toward pioneer and me-too follower brands: A comparative study of Japan and the USA (2001) International Marketing Review, 18 (2), pp. 160-187; Alpert, F.H., Kamins, M.A., An empirical investigation of consumer memory, attitude, and perceptions toward pioneer and follower brands (1995) Journal of Marketing, 59, pp. 34-45. , OCTOBER; Auh, S., Shih, E., Brand name and consumer inference making in multigenerational product introduction context (2009) Journal of Brand Management, 16 (7), pp. 439-454; Bertini, M., Gourville, J.T., Ofek, E., The branding of next-generation products (2007) MSI Working Paper Series 07-113; Boone, D.S., Lemon, K.N., Staelin, R., The impact of firm introductory strategies on consumers' perceptions of future product introductions and purchase decisions (2001) Journal of Product Innovation Management, 18, pp. 96-109; Brown, C.L., Lattin, J.M., Investigating the relationship between time in market and pioneering advantage (1994) Management Science, 40 (10), pp. 1361-1369; Carpenter, G.S., Nakamoto, K., Consumer preference formation and pioneering advantage (1989) Journal of Marketing Research, 26 (3), pp. 285-298; Cho, D., Kim, D., Rhee, D., Latecomer strategies: Evidence from the semiconductor industry in Japan and Korea (1998) Organization Science, 9 (4), pp. 489-505; Choe, S.H., In South Korea, all of life is mobile (2009) The New York Times, , http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/25/technology/25iht-mobile.htm?_r=1, May 24; Choi, I.H., Korea achieved the impossible within 20 years (2010) The Korea Times, , August 18; Gillespie, K., Hennessey, H.D., (2010) Global Marketing Management, , (3rd ed.).

They concern virtually the entire energy chain, from resource extraction to technologies, energy demand, and the stringency of future environmental policies. Investment decisions today need thus not only to be cost-effective from the present perspective, but have to take into account also the imputed future risks of above uncertainties. This chapter introduces a newly developed modeling decision framework with endogenous representation of above uncertainties.We employ modeling techniques from finance and in particular modern portfolio theory to a systems engineering model of the global energy system and implement several alternative representations of risk. We aim to identify salient characteristics of leastcost risk hedging strategies that are adapted to considerably reduce future risks and are hence robust against a wide range of future uncertainties. These lead to significant changes in response to energy system and carbon price uncertainties, in particular (i) higher short- to medium-term investments into advanced technologies, (ii) pronounced emissions reductions, and (iii) diversification of the technology portfolio. From a methodological perspective, we find that there are strong interactions and synergies between different types of uncertainties. Cost-effective risk hedging strategies thus need to take a holistic view and comprehensively account for all uncertainties jointly. With respect to costs, relatively modest risk premiums (or hedging investments) can significantly reduce the vulnerability of the energy system against the associated uncertainties. The extent of early investments, diversification, and emissions reductions, however, depends on the risk premium that decision makers are willing to pay to respond to prevailing uncertainties and remains thus one of the key policy variables. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.",,,"Ascough, I., Maier, H.R., Ravalico, J.K., Strudley, M.W., Future research challenges for incorporation of uncertainty in environmental and ecological decision-making (2008) Ecol Model, 219 (3-4), pp. 383-399; Babonneau, F., Kanudia, A., Labriet, M., Loulou, R., Vial, J.-P., Energy security: A robust optimization approach to design a robust european energy supply via tiam-world (2012) Environmodel Assess, 17 (1-2), pp. 19-37; Beale, E., On minimizing a convex function subject to linear inequalities (1955) J R Stat Soc Series B (Methodological), 17 (2), pp. 173-184; Ben-Tal, A., El Ghaoui, L., Nemirovski, A., (2009) Robust Optimization, , Princeton University Press, Princeton; Carnell, R., (2006) Lhs: Latin Hypercube Samples, , R package version 0.3; Charnes, A., Cooper, W., Chance constrained programming (1959) Manag Sci, 6, pp. 73-89; Dantzig, G.B., Linear programming under uncertainty (1955) Manag Sci, 1, pp. 197-206; De Vries, B., Van Vuuren, D.P., Hoogwijk, M.M., Renewable energy sources: Their global potential for the first-half of the 21st century at a global level: An integrated approach (2007) Energy Policy, 35 (4), pp. 2590-2610; Dessai, S., Hulme, M., Assessing the robustness of adaptation decisions to climate change uncertainties: A case study on water resources management in the east of england (2007) Glob Environ Change, 17 (1), pp. 59-72; Ermoliev, Y., Wets, R.J., (1988) Numerical Techniques for Stochastic Optimization, Vol 10 of Springer Series in Computational Mathematics, , Springer, Berlin; Fisher, B., Nakicenovic, N., Alfsen, K., Morlot, J.C., De La Chesnaye, F., Hourcade, J.-C., Jiang, K., Warren, R., Issues related to mitigation in the long term context (2007) Climate Change 2007: Mitigation, pp. 169-250. , In:Metz B, Davidson O, Bosch P, Dave R, Meyer L (eds), Contribution of working group III to the fourth assessment report of the inter-governmental panel on climate change.

Then, when exporting cultural goods, how can organizations manage the risks of uncertainty to improve their export performance? Focusing on the case of the Korean movie industry, this study shows that strategies such as market signaling, generalist strategy and vertical integration can contribute to improving the export performance of movies, and thereby help organizations effectively manage the risks of uncertainty arising from the export of movies. For the analysis, this study uses the data of all Korean movies released from 2000 to 2004, and analyzes them on the basis of negative binominal regression. The findings of this study help us understand what strategies are needed for organizations in cultural industry to manage the risks of uncertainty arising from the export of cultural goods.

This paper examines the trade-off between the effects of reduced uncertainty and demand cannibalization, uncovers the condition under which software firms should introduce the time-locked free trial software, and finds the optimal free trial time. As software firms have the option of providing free trial software with full functionalities but a limited trial time or limited functionalities for an unlimited trial time, we develop a unified framework to provide useful guidelines for deciding which free trial strategy is preferred in the presence of network externalities and consumer uncertainty. © 2012 INFORMS.","Demo software; Experience goods; Network effect; Product sampling; Product trial; Software free trial; Time-locked free trial","Experience goods; Free trials; Network effects; Product samplings; Product trial; Industry; Optimization","Bawa, K., Shoemanker, R., Effects of free sample promotions on incremental brand sales (2004) Marketing Sci, 23 (3), pp. 345-363; Bergemann, D., Schlag, K.H., Pricing without priors (2008) J.

Leveraging the existing political markets literature, we predict regulatory uncertainty from the novel interaction of demand- and supply-side rivalries across a range of political markets. We argue for two primary drivers of regulatory uncertainty: ideology-motivated interests opposed to the firm and a lack of competition for power among political actors supplying public policy. We align three previously disparate dimensions of nonmarket strategy-profile level, coalition breadth, and pivotal target-to levels of regulatory uncertainty. Through this framework we demonstrate how and when firms employ different nonmarket strategies. To illustrate variation in nonmarket strategy across levels of regulatory uncertainty, we analyze several market entry decisions of foreign firms operating in the global telecommunications sector.",,,"Ansolabehere, S., De Figueiredo, J., Snyder, J., Why is there so little money in U.

Specifically, this study investigated the prevalence of three interactive uncertainty reduction strategies (i.e., self-disclosure, question asking, and question/disclosure intimacy) in reduced-cue settings. Moreover, this study investigated whether these uncertainty reduction strategies increased the verbal statements of affection in CMC. Eighty-one unacquainted cross-sex dyads were randomly assigned to three experimental conditions: face-to-face, visual CMC supported by a webcam, or text-only CMC. Content analysis of the verbal communication revealed that text-only CMC interactants made a greater proportion of affection statements than face-to-face interactants. Proportions of question asking and question/disclosure intimacy were higher in both CMC conditions than in the face-to-face condition, but only question asking mediated the relationship between CMC and verbal statements of affection. No differences in question asking, question/disclosure intimacy, and verbal statements of affection were observed between the text-only CMC condition and the visual CMC condition. This study provided additional support for social information processing theory by specifying the role of different language-based strategies that may be employed online. © The Author(s) 2012.","computer-mediated communication; content analysis; question asking; self-disclosure; social information processing theory; statements of affection; uncertainty reduction theory",,"Afifi, W.A., Metts, S., Characteristics and consequences of expectation violation in close relationships (1998) Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 15, pp. 365-392; Albada, K.F., Knapp, M.L., Theune, K.E., Interaction appearance theory: Changing perceptions of physical attractiveness through social interaction (2002) Communication Theory, 12, pp. 8-40; Alferes, V.R., Kenny, D.A., SPSS programs for the measurement of nonindependence in standard dyadic designs (2009) Behavior Research Methods, 41, pp. 47-54; Altman, I., Taylor, D.A., (1973) Social Penetration: The Development of Interpersonal Relationships, , New York, NY: Holt, Rinehart and Winston; Antheunis, M.L., Valkenburg, P.M., Peter, J., Computer-mediated communication and interpersonal attraction: An experimental test of two explanatory hypotheses (2007) CyberPsychology & Behavior, 10, pp. 831-836; Antheunis, M.L., Valkenburg, P.M., Peter, J., Getting acquainted through social networking sites: Testing a model of online uncertainty reduction and social attraction (2010) Computers in Human Behavior, 26, pp. 100-109; Bargh, J.A., McKenna, K.Y., Fitzsimons, G.M., Can you see the real me?

Clear associations between market, technological, and competitive uncertainties and competitive strategy were not found in either nation. Chinese and Turkish organizations pursuing prospector, defender, and analyzer strategies outperformed their counterparts pursuing the reactor strategy. Scores along Porter's typology suggested marked differences between managers' conceptualization of competitive strategy in both countries. Along the Miles and Snow typology, defenders represented the highest performing group in China, whereas analyzers outperformed other groups in Turkey. Similarities and differences in findings between the two nations are elaborated. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","China; Culture; Miles and snow; Performance; Porter; Strategy; Turkey; Typologies; Uncertainty",,"Akbolat, M., (2009) Competition Strategies In Turkey's Health Sector: A Study of Hospitals, , (Doctoral Dissertation, Sakarya University, Institute of Social Sciences and Business Management, Sakarya, Turkey); Akgemci, T., (2007) Strategic Management, , Ankara, Turkey: Gazi Kitabevi; Akman, G., Özkan, C., Eriş, H., Analysis of the effects of strategy orientation and firm strategies on firm performance (2008) Science Journal, 13, pp. 93-115. , Istanbul Ticaret University; Allen, R.S., Helms, M.M., Linking strategic practices and organizational performance to Porter's generic strategies (2006) Business Process Management Journal, 12, pp. 433-454; Alpay, G., Bodur, M., Yilmaz, C., Performance implications of institutionalization process in family-owned businesses: Evidence from an emerging economy (2008) Journal of World Business, 43, pp. 435-448; Ambrosini, V., Bowman, C., What are dynamic capabilities and are they a useful construct in strategic management?

Lead time uncertainty is known as one of the types of supply side risks or uncertainty that affects ordering policies, inventory levels and cost, and product availability level. Information sharing between supply chain members provides opportunities to reduce the inventory levels held to face such uncertainty thereby improving the performance of the supply chain. In this context, we study the effect of sharing the information regarding replenishment leadtime on total inventory costs in a two-level supply chain. In this paper, we have proposed two-level supply chain model to analyse the effects of leadtime information and to quantify the value of the information about lead-times to the retailer. We assume that the replenishment leadtime of the supplier is random and following uniform distribution and we consider two replenishment policies the first one for the case without information sharing and the second one with information sharing. With information sharing in place the retailer exercise the strategy of employing an emergency supplier to mitigate the leadtime uncertainty. The system under consideration is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem and the simulation exercise results indicate that the value of leadtime information can be significant.

We find that market volatility has great impacts on the optimal degree of product modularity and the timing for modular production. The results show that when market is more volatile, it is optimal for a firm to postpone modularization, and when a firms investment efficiency at the preparation stage is higher, the firm can start modular production earlier with relatively low product modularity. Also, an increase in market uncertainty will stimulate the firm to improve its product modularity. Finally, by comparing the predictions from the widely used net present value method (NPV) to the results from our real options model, we argue that traditional NPV method underestimates a firms value for modular production and might mislead a firm to modularize earlier. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

However, most empirical evidences on contemporary MAP and its relation to contingent factors are centered on manufacturing industry. The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of contemporary MAP on the relationship between (1) differentiation strategy and performance and (2) environment uncertainty and performance in service industry i.e., hotel industry. Assessment on these contingencies relationships are tested with a path analytical model using AMOS 18. Data are collected using survey questionnaire from 65 hotels which have 3-5 stars status in Indonesia. The research findings reveal the existence of a significant and positive association between differentiation strategy and hotel performance through high use of contemporary MAP. In contrast, the study found no significant relationship between environment uncertainty and hotel performance through the same practices. The findings indicate that the design of contemporary MAP in hotel industry is much influenced by internal contingent factor that can be controlled by the hotels.",,,"Abdel-Kader, M., Luther, R., The impact of firms characteristics on management accounting practices: A UK-based empirical analysis (2008) The British Accounting Review, 40, pp. 2-27; Abernethy, M.A., Guthrie, C.H., An empirical assessment of the fit between strategy and management information systems design (1994) Accounting and Finance, 33, pp. 49-66; Agbejule, A., The relationship between management accounting systems and perceived environmental uncertainty on managerial performance: A research note (2005) Accounting and Business Research, 35 (4), pp. 295-305; Anderson, S., Guilding, C., Competitor-focused accounting applied to a hotel context (2006) International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 18 (3), pp. 206-218. , DOI 10.1108/09596110610658616; Angelakis, G., Theriou, N., Floropoulos, I., Adoption and benefits of management accounting practices: Evidence from Greece and Findland (2010) Advances in Accounting, Incorporating Advances in International Acocunting, 26, pp. 87-96; Anthony, R.N., Dearden, J., Bedford, N.M., (1989) Management Control Systems, , Ed. ke-6.

Motivated by the practice, the replenishment times need to be determined and frozen once and for all at the beginning of the horizon while decisions on the exact replenishment quantities can be deferred until the replenishment time. This operating scheme is refereed to as a ""static-dynamic uncertainty"" strategy in the literature [3]. We consider dynamic fixed-ordering and linear end-of-period holding costs, as well as dynamic penalty costs, or service levels. We prove that the optimal ordering policy is a base stock policy for both penalty cost and service level constrained models. Since an exponential exhaustive search based on dynamic programming yields the optimal ordering periods and the associated base stock levels, it is not possible to compute the optimal policy parameters for longer planning horizons. Thus, we develop two heuristics. Numerical experiments show that both heuristics perform well in terms of solution quality and scale-up efficiently; hence, any practically relevant large instance can be solved in reasonable time. Finally, we discuss how our results and heuristics can be extended to handle capacity limitations and minimum order quantity considerations. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Heuristic; Non-stationary; Penalty cost; Service level; Static-dynamic uncertainty; Stochastic demand",,"Blackburn, J.D., Kropp, D.H., Millen, R.A., A comparison of strategies to dampen nervousness in MRP systems (1986) Management Science, 32, pp. 413-429; Bookbinder, J.H., H'Ng, B.T., Rolling horizon production planning for probabilistic time-varying demands (1986) International Journal of Production Research, 24, pp. 1439-1458; Bookbinder, J.H., Tan, J.Y., Strategies for the probabilistic lot-sizing problem with service-level constraints (1988) Management Science, 34, pp. 1096-1108; Halman, N., Klabjan, D., Mostagir, M., Orlin, J., Simchi-Levi, D., A fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for single-item stochastic inventory control with discrete demand (2009) Mathematics of Operations Research, 34, pp. 674-685; Inderfurth, K., Nervousness in inventory control (1994) OR Spektrum, 16, pp. 113-123; Karlin, S., Dynamic inventory policy with varying stochastic demands (1960) Management Science, 6, pp. 231-258; Karlin, S., Optimal policy for dynamic inventory process with stochastic demands subject to seasonal variations (1960) Journal of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, 8, pp. 611-629; Khouja, B., The single period (news-vendor) problem: literature review and suggestions for future research (1999) Omega, 27, pp. 537-553; Kingsman, B.G., (1985) Raw materials purchasing: an operational research approach, , Elsevier Science and Technology Books; Li, Q., Wu, X., Cheung, K.L., Optimal policies for inventory systems with separate delivery-request and order-quantity decisions (2009) Operations Research, 57, pp. 626-636; Morton, T.E., Pentico, D.W., The finite horizon nonstationary stochastic inventory problem: near-myopic bounds, heuristics, testing (1995) Management Science, 41, pp. 334-343; Mutlu, F., Cetinkaya, S., Bookbinder, J.H., An analytical model for computing the optimal time-and-quantity-based policy for consolidated shipments (2010) IIE Transactions, 42, pp. 367-377; Sethi, S.P., Cheng, F., Optimality of (s,s) policies in inventory models with Markovian demand (1997) Operations Research, 45, pp. 931-939; Silver, E.A., Pyke, D.F., Peterson, R., (1998) Inventory management and production planning and scheduling, , John Wiley & Sons; Sox, C.R., Dynamic lot sizing with random demand and non-stationary costs (1997) Operations Research Letters, 20, pp. 155-164; Tarim, S.A., Doĝru, M.K., Özen, U., Rossi, R., (2009), An efficient computational method for non-stationary (R,S) inventory policy with service level constraints.

Because of the limited fleet capacity, the logistics company has to hire additional trucks from two countries in advance. However, customer's shipment information is uncertain, and the accurate shipment notice is only available on the shipping day. This paper proposes a dual-response logistics strategy to be as responsive as possible for coping with short shipment notice time and uncertainty involved. A two-stage stochastic mixed 0-1 programming model is formulated to satisfy customer demand while minimizing the total logistics cost. A series of experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed stochastic model. Compared to the corresponding expected value model, the stochastic model provides a more responsive and less expensive global logistics system. © 2012 The Authors.

The strategic group level of analysis was employed. Generic strategy, environmental uncertainty, and performance were measured by previously validated scales. The combination strategy-performance linkage was supported in Turkey and the USA. In China, the highest performing strategic group emphasized a focus orientation accompanied by neither cost leadership nor differentiation, and the lowest performing group was comprised of low cost businesses. This study supported the combination strategy thesis in the USA and Turkey. In China, conceptualizations of strategy appear to be more complex. High performing businesses emphasized a focus strategy, but not necessarily in concert with either cost leadership or differentiation. Firms in the USA place a great deal of emphasis on uniqueness and individuality, translating into approaches based on differentiation and innovation. However, attempting to control costs and differentiate without a defined niche leaves a firm vulnerable to larger, more experienced competition. This study addresses the death of strategy-performance investigations in developing nations. Findings presented run counter to the notion that successful businesses in emerging economies emphasize cost leadership vis-à-vis differentiation. Conventional wisdom suggests that high performers tend to perceive greater certainty about their environments. The present analysis not only rejected this finding, but suggests that the opposite might be true. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Business strategy; Cross-cultural management; Strategic groups; Uncertainty",,"Aguilar, F.J., (1967) Scanning and Business Environment, pp. 69-70. , Macmillan, New York, NY; Allen, R.S., Helms, M.M., Linking strategic practices and organizational performance to Porter's generic strategies (2006) Business Process Management Journal, 12, pp. 433-454; Altay, A., Aksaraylı, M., KOBİ Destek Programlarının Kuramsal Boyutunun Analizi (2007) 4.

In addition, we investigate the moderating role of environmental uncertainty on the effects of innovation strategy execution and innovation-focused HR policy on innovation performance. Results show that the interaction of innovation strategy execution and innovation-focused HR policy is positively related to innovation performance. Results also show that environmental uncertainty positively moderates the innovation strategy execution-innovation performance relationship. Finally, innovation performance mediates the interaction of innovation strategy execution and environmental uncertainty on firms' revenue growth. Implications of these findings for theory and practice are discussed. © 2012 The Authors.

The paper is a theoretical paper based on a number of Swedish studies, both case studies and questionnaires. From these a number of stylized facts have been identified and the purpose is to explain and draw conclusions from these. The main finding is that there are a number of specific uncertainties that affect building maintenance planning making more detailed long-term plans less meaningful. A new structure for maintenance is proposed focusing on long-term strategies goals for various buildings/components and then short run adjustments when new information comes up. The case for the new model needs to be strengthened by further studies, including studies from other countries. Maintenance activities will be more important as the large building stock from the 1950s and 1960s needs to be renovated or demolished. A rational structure and realistic expectations concerning maintenance planning is then important. The most important contribution of the article is to underline the importance of different types of uncertainty for the structure of maintenance planning for building. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Maintenance planning; Maintenance programmes; Property management; Uncertainty management",,"Ahuja, I., Khamba, J., Total productive maintenance: literature review and directions (2008) International Journal of Quality & Reliability Management, 25 (7), pp. 709-756; Allström, R., Bengtsson, M., (2002) Tillståndsbaserat underhåll – En överblick av underhållsteorin samt teknikensmöjligheter på spårfordon (Condition-based maintenance- An overview of the maintenance theory and its potentials on rail vehicles), , masters thesis, IDT-Mälardalens Högskola, Mälardalens University, Västerås; Almgren, T., Andréasson, N., Anevski, D., Patriksson, M., Strömberg, A.-B., Svensson, J., Optimization of opportunistic replacement activities: a case study in the aircraft industry (2008), www.math.chalmers.se/Math/Research/Preprints/2008/45.pdf, Math Department, Chalmers University, Gothenberg, available at: (accessed January 29, 2011)Al-Najjar, B., Total quality maintenance: an approach for continuous reduction in costs of quality products (1996) Journal of Quality in Maintenance Engineering, 2 (3), pp. 4-20; Backlund, F., Akersten, P.A., RCM introduction: process and requirements management aspects (2003) Journal of Quality in Maintenance Engineering, 9 (3), pp. 250-264; Badia, F., Berrade, M., Campos, C.A., Optimal inspection and preventive maintenance of units with revealed and unrevealed failures (2002) Reliability Engineering and System Safety, 78 (2), pp. 157-163; Bahrami-Ghasrchami, K., Price, J., Mathew, J., Optimum inspection frequency for manufacturing systems (1998) International Journal of Quality & Reliability Management, 15 (3), pp. 250-258; Barbera, F., Schneider, H., Watson, E., A condition-based maintenance model for a two-unit series system (1999) European Journal of Operational Research, 116 (2), pp. 281-290; Bejrum, H., Se om sitt hus.

The scarcity of data, however, prevents the application of standard approaches that are based on data-driven models. The Hindu KushKarakoramHimalaya mountain range is a crucial area in terms of water resources, but our understanding of the response of its high-elevation catchments to a changing climate is hindered by lack of hydro-meteorological and cryospheric data. Hydrological modeling is challenging here because internal inconsistenciessuch as an underestimation of precipitation input that can be compensated for by an overestimation of meltwatermight be hidden due to the complexity of feedback mechanisms that govern melt and runoff generation in such basins. Data scarcity adds to this difficulty by preventing the application of systematic calibration procedures that would allow identification of the parameter set that could guarantee internal consistency in the simulation of the single hydrological components. In this work, we use simulations from the Hunza River Basin in the Karakoram region obtained with the hydrological model TOPKAPI to quantify the predictive power of discharge and snow-cover data sets, as well as the combination of both. We also show that short-term measurements of meteorological variables such as radiative fluxes, wind speed, relative humidity, and air temperature from glacio-meteorological experiments are crucial for a correct parameterization of surface melt processes. They enable detailed simulations of the energy fluxes governing glacieratmosphere interaction and the resulting ablation through energy-balance modeling. These simulations are used to derive calibrated parameters for the simplified snow and glacier routines in TOPKAPI. We demonstrate that such parameters are stable in space and time in similar climatic regions, thus reducing the number of parameters requiring calibration. © 2012 by the authors.","energy-balance modeling; enhanced-temperature-index melt model; glacier melt; Hunza River Basin; Hydrological modeling; model calibration; multiobjective calibration; Pakistan; TOPKAPI","calibration; catchment; climate change; data set; energy balance; feedback mechanism; hydrological modeling; hydrometeorology; meltwater; mountain region; multiobjective programming; precipitation (climatology); river basin; runoff; rural area; rural development; snow cover; uncertainty analysis; water resource; Gilgit-Baltistan; Hindu Kush; Hunza Basin; Karakoram; Pakistan","Akhtar, M., Ahmad, N., Booij, M.J., Use of regional climate model simulations as input for hydrological models for the Hindukush-Karakorum- Himalaya region (2009) Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 13, pp. 1075-1089. , www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/13/1075/2009/; Anderton, S., Latron, J., Gallart, F., Sensitivity analysis and multi-response, multi-criteria evaluation of a physically based distributed model (2002) Hydrological Processes, 16 (2), pp. 333-353. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.336; Bergstrom, S., Lindstrom, G., Pettersson, A., Multi-variable parameter estimation to increase confidence in hydrological modelling (2002) Hydrological Processes, 16, pp. 413-421. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.332; Beven, K., How far can we go in distributed hydrological modelling?

To test the null, we examine whether the 52-week high criterion has more predictive power in cases of larger information uncertainty. This hypothesis is based on the psychological insight that behavioral biases increase in uncertainty. For six proxies of ambiguity, we document a positive relationship to returns of 52-week high winner stocks and a negative relationship to returns of 52-week high loser stocks. The opposite effect of information uncertainty on winner and loser stocks implies that the 52-week high profits are increasing in uncertainty measures. Moreover, the study documents that the six variables have a similar impact on momentum profits. Hence, we cannot reject the hypothesis that anchoring explains the profits of the 52-week high strategy and that it is the driver of the momentum anomaly. © 2011 Swiss Society for Financial Market Research.","Behavioral finance; Momentum",,"Agyei-Ampomah, S., The post-cost profitability of momentum trading strategies: further evidence from the UK (2003) European Financial Management, pp. 776-802; Barberis, N., Thaler, R., (2002) A survey of behavioral finance, , Working Paper; Barberis, N., Shleifer, A., Vishny, R., A model of investor sentiment (1998) J.

This paper provides a conceptual review of the literature on the role of uncertainty in entry-mode strategies. It is found that transaction cost theory has focused primarily on entry modes as a way of minimizing behavioural uncertainty, while research using the more recent real options approach has distinguished between endogenous and exogenous types of uncertainty and provided evidence that managing uncertainty through appropriate entry modes may lead to competitive advantage. By synthesizing the relevant literature, this paper provides some new perspectives and avenues for future research on uncertainty and entry-mode choices by considering the impact of firm learning, prior experience and host market attractiveness. © 2011 The Authors.

Yet forecasts invariably turn out to be different than the numbers that actually occur. Yet, most producers of forecasts only present a deterministic view of the future in the form of point predictions. However, the presence of uncertainty is inherent in management or policy decisions and there is often concern that benefits are overstated and risks are understated. Such concerns are difficult to address by providing only point forecasts with no assessment of their uncertainty. Having a better understanding of uncertainty can enhance the usefulness of forecasts and make the work of forecasting agencies an even more valuable product for planners, policy makers, and the public. The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, it presents an overview of the current state-of-the-practice is assessing forecast uncertainty. Second, it offers a guidelines and options for implementing and building uncertainty into small area forecasting processes. There are options for assessing forecasting uncertainty that can and should be implemented by most, if not all, producers of forecasts. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Decision-making; Forecast uncertainty; Implementation strategy","decision making; forecasting method; implementation process; policy making; strategic approach; uncertainty analysis","Ahlburg, D., Lutz, W., Vaupel, J., Ways to improve population forecasting: What should be done differently in the future (1998) Population and Development Review, 24, pp. 191-198. , (Supplement: Frontiers of Population Forecasting); Alho, J., Stochastic methods in population forecasting (1990) International Journal of Forecasting, 6, pp. 521-530; Bongaarts, J., Bulatao, R., The uncertainty of population forecasts (2000) Beyond six billion: Forecasting the world's population, pp. 118-217. , In J.

In this paper, we investigate the benefits from supplier diversification for dual-sourcing duopolists. We consider a two-echelon supply chain in which suppliers sell components to buyers who produce and sell substitutable products. The suppliers' output processes are uncertain and modeled as having a proportional random yield. Buyers engage in a quantity-based Cournot competition. We find that an increase in supplier correlation leads to more correlated buyers' outputs and a decrease in their profits. In the presence of end-market competition, dual sourcing still brings value by reducing the inefficiency caused by random yield: Namely, when the suppliers' yield processes are strongly negatively correlated, dual sourcing increases the expected market output and improves the firms' profits over sole sourcing. However, unlike a monopolist firm, a duopolist does not necessarily allocate its supplier orders to minimize output variability. We generalize the main results to a two-stage order-quantity-output-quantity game and to one with asymmetric suppliers. © 2011 INFORMS.","Cournot competition; Dual sourcing; Equilibrium; Random yield; Supply uncertainty","Cournot competition; Diversification strategies; Dual sourcing; End markets; Output variability; Random yield; Substitutable products; Supply uncertainty; Two stage; Two-echelon supply chain; Profitability; Sales; Supply chains; Competition","Agrawal, N., Nahmias, S., Rationalization of the supplier base in the presence of yield uncertainty (1997) Production and Operations Management, 6 (3), pp. 291-308; Anupindi, R., Akella, R., Diversification under supply uncertainty (1993) Management Sci., 39 (8), pp. 944-963; Aydin, G., Babich, V., Beil, D., Yang, Z., Decentralized supply risk management (2011) Handbook of Integrated Risk Management in Global Supply Chains, , P.

These strategies have evolved relatively rapidly of late in part because of changes in the locus of innovation from OEMs to suppliers, changing market conditions, and the future regulations of greenhouse gases. This presents a unique challenge for the industry. Some auto firms have been more effective in dealing with market and regulatory uncertainty due to technology resource integration across platforms and integration between functions on the value added chain from suppliers to retailers. © 2011 by The Regents of the University of California.

As integrated strategies, they both recognize non-market forces while taking into account market realities. Advocating for pragmatic, progressive policies enables firms to shape future policy around existing environmental strengths; this strategy raises competitors' costs when competitors have yet to develop identical competencies. Systematically embracing advancing regulation enables firms to satisfy activists who are pressuring policymakers to force firms to conform to higher environmental standards in other jurisdictions; this strategy allows managers to adapt to coming regulation at their own pace while leveraging market competencies.

While research generally recognizes the importance of flexibility in new product launch, it has rarely examined the dynamic adjustments after initial launch, largely due to the limitation of conventional methodologies in modeling dynamic feedbacks and interactions. This study develops a system dynamics model of new product launch that formalizes the adjustments of launch scale according to actual market conditions and the dynamic interactions among launch scale and various tactical elements of product launch, including advertising, distribution, pricing, manufacturing, and inventory management. This study makes a first attempt to bring systems dynamic modeling to new product launch research and illustrates a new approach to examine dynamic feedbacks in the new product launch process. The model developed in this study illustrates why and how dynamic approaches outperform static ones, and reveals important insights of the behavior of dynamic product launch strategies. The model can be used as a flight simulator in managerial training to help new product managers understand the dynamic interactions among different elements of new product launch. © 2011 IEEE.","Market uncertainty; new product launch; system dynamics model","Dynamic adjustment; Dynamic feedback; Dynamic interaction; Dynamic product; Inventory management; Market condition; Market uncertainty; New product; Product launch; System dynamics model; Systems dynamics; Commerce; Flight simulators; Inventory control; Launching; System theory; Dynamic models","Cooper, R.G., The dimensions of industrial new product success and failure (1979) J.

Over the last few decades pastoralists have been affected by the loss of grazing lands and increasing climatic variability. Many pastoralists who reside around PAs have resorted to grazing inside PAs to counter environmental variability. However, there is little information on how PAs influence the herding strategies of pastoralists. This case study from southern Kenya employs a spatially and temporally explicit mixed-methods approach to understand and evaluate the herding strategies of pastoralists around a PA. The results find that pastoralists access PAs on a regular basis, regardless of seasonality or herd size. Movement into PAs was partly driven by the loss of grazing land to conservancies. PAs affected pastoral herding by presenting differential opportunity costs to disparate groups. However, households with large herd sizes utilized the most flexible strategies to counter environmental variability and uncertainty. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Coping strategies; Cultural ecology; Drought; Herding strategies; Kenya; Pastoralists; Protected areas","climate variation; coping strategy; drought; environmental impact; grazing pressure; nature-society relations; pastoralism; protected area; Kenya","Adriansen, H.K., Nielsen, T.T., The Geography of Pastoral Mobility: A Spatio-Temporal Analysis of GPS Data from Sahelian Senegal (2005) GeoJournal, 64 (3), pp. 177-188; Allen, K., (2006) Drought threat to Kenya's parks, , http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/2/hi/africa/4725152.stm, BBC News Online, 17 February Last Accessed 4 April 2007; Anderson, D., Grove, R., (1987) Conservation in Africa: People, Policies, and Practice, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Ausseill, R., (2009) Kenya's Hippos Hard Hit by Drought, , http://www.physorg.com/news170833518.html, Last Accessed May 29, 2010; Bassett, T.J., Hired Herders and Herd Management in Fulani Pastoralism (Northern Cote d'Ivoire) (1994) Cahiers D'etudes Africaines, 133-135, pp. 147-173; Boko, M., Niang, I., Nyong, A., Vogel, C., Githeko, A., Medany, M., Osman-Elasha, B., Yanda, P., Africa.

Recent work demonstrates that, when confronted with unforeseeable uncertainties, managers can adopt either a learning, trial-and-error-based strategy, or a parallel approach. In the latter, different solutions are developed in parallel and the best one is chosen when enough information becomes available. Studying the case of the Manhattan Project, which historically exemplifies the power of the parallel approach, has led us to show that the either/or logic underlying the existing literature on the parallel approach oversimplifies the question. The Manhattan case demonstrates that managers must not necessarily choose between solutions, but can also combine them or add new ones during the project. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA.","Combination; Innovation; Manhattan Project; Parallel approach; Project management; Unforeseeable uncertainty","Combination; Manhattan Project; Manhattans; Parallel approach; Unforeseeable uncertainty; Managers; Project management; innovation; project management; strategic approach; uncertainty role; Kansas; Manhattan; United States","Bird, K., Sherwin, M., (2005) American Prometheus.

A total of 604 questionnaires were collected from three cities in China, and the statistical results show significant moderating effects of external environment on the relationships among competitive strategy, supply chain strategy, and business performance. Firms that primarily focus on a differentiation strategy emphasize an agile supply chain strategy. Cost leaders are inclined to implement both lean and agile supply chain strategies, but their emphasis on agile strategy is significantly greater in a volatile environment than in a stable environment. The choice of supply chain strategy does not appear to be an ""either-or"" decision and firms could adopt either a lean or an agile strategy, or both, depending on the environment. This article provides significant managerial implications for supply chain practitioners to co-align supply chain strategy and competitive strategy with the environment to improve performance. © 2011 The Authors Decision Sciences Journal © 2011 Decision Sciences Institute.","Competitive Strategy; Structural Equation Modeling; Supply Chain Design; Survey Research",,"Beamon, B.M., Measuring supply chain performance (1999) International Journal of Operations & Production Management, 19 (3), pp. 275-292; Beverly, K.B., Morgan, R.M., The moderating effect of organizational cohesiveness in knowledge use and new product development (2006) Academy of Marketing Science Journal, 34 (3), pp. 295-307; Bourgeois III, L.J., Strategy and environment: A conceptual integration (1980) Academy of Management Review, 5 (1), pp. 25-39; Búrca, S., Fynes, B., Brannick, T., The moderating effects of information technology sophistication on services practice and performance (2006) International Journal of Operations & Production Management, 26 (11), pp. 1240-1254; Cagliano, R., Caniato, F., Gianluca, S., Lean, agile and traditional supply: How do they impact manufacturing performance (2004) Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management, 10 (4-5), pp. 151-164; Chen, I.J., Paulraj, A., Towards a theory of supply chain management: The constructs and measurements (2004) Journal of Operations Management, 22 (2), pp. 119-150; Christopher, M., The agile supply chain: Competing in volatile markets (2000) Industrial Marketing Management, 29 (1), pp. 37-44; Christopher, M., Towill, D.R., Supply chain migration from lean and functional to agile and customized (2000) Supply Chain Management: An International Journal, 5 (4), pp. 206-213; Christopher, M., Towill, D., An integrated model for the design of agile supply chains (2001) International Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management, 31 (4), pp. 235-246; Cigolini, R., Cozzi, M., Perona, M., A new framework for supply chain management: Conceptual model and empirical test (2004) International Journal of Operations & Production Management, 24 (1), pp. 7-41; Dess, G., Davis, P., Porter's 1980 generic strategies as determinants of strategic groups' membership and organizational performance (1984) Academy of Management Journal, 27 (3), pp. 467-488; Dong, Y., Carter, C.R., Dresner, M.E., JIT purchasing and performance: An exploratory analysis of buyer and supplier perspectives (2001) Journal of Operations Management, 19 (4), pp. 471-483; Fisher, M.L., What is the right supply chain for your product (1997) Harvard Business Review, 75 (2), pp. 105-116; Fornell, C., Larcker, D.F., Evaluating structural equation models with unobservable variables and measurement error (1981) Journal of Marketing Research, 18 (1), pp. 29-50; Goldman, S., Nagel, R., Preiss, K., (1995) Agile competitors and virtual organizations, , New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold; Gunasekaran, A., Patel, C., Tirtiroglu, E., Performance measures and metrics in a supply chain environment (2001) International Journal of Operations & Production Management, 21 (1-2), pp. 71-87; Hair, J.F., Anderson, R.E., Tatham, R.L., Black, W.C., (1998) Multivariate data analysis, , (5th ed.).

The evidence confirms that pharmaceutical firms enter different in the external technology sourcing. Moreover, RO-based entry coefficients differ in sizes at different levels in the industrial value chain. The R&D entry stage is relatively greater than the clinical trials entry stage. However, contrary to the proposition that the commercial entry coefficient will be relatively lower; the results indicate that the commercial RO-entry stage appears to be relatively greater than both the R&D entry stage and the clinical trials entry stage. The overall RO-based entry in external technology sourcing appears to be a U-shaped curve along the product life cycle.

Firstly, the delineation methods make assumption of error-free data, which is an unreachable utopia even with modern sensor technology. Secondly, even though the computing capacity has increased dramatically during the last decades, sizes of geospatial data sets have increased simultaneously. Thus far, the typical problems arising when using uncertainty-aware geospatial analysis are 1) the computational complexity of the analysis and 2) memory allocation problems when large datasets are used. In this paper, we raise the question about the general need for developing scalable and uncertainty-aware algorithms for terrain analysis and propose improvements to the existing drainage basin calculation methods. The distributed uncertainty-aware catchment delineation methods with and without spatial partitioning of the DEM are introduced and the performance of the methods in different cases are compared. © 2009 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.","Digital elevation model;

Based on a literature review, we categorize responses according to their objective toward regulatory uncertainty into four strategies: avoidance, reduction, adaptation, and disregard strategies. Unique data from a worldwide cross-industry survey show that firms predominantly pursue reduction, and to a lesser extent adaptation and disregard strategies, in response to post-Kyoto regulatory uncertainty. Surprisingly, firms in fact only sporadically pursue avoidance strategies, in contradiction to their own public announcements commonly made during policymaking to realize such strategies. The degree of regulatory uncertainty perceived and its interpretation as a threat increase the pursuit of most of these strategies. In addition, firms' response strategies to post-Kyoto regulatory uncertainty differ across industries and partly across regions. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Climate change; Corporate strategy;

The authors propose a conceptual model integrating privacy concerns, self-efficacy, and Internet experience with uncertainty reduction strategies and amount of self-disclosure and then test this model on a nationwide sample of online dating participants (N = 562). The study findings confirm that the frequency of use of uncertainty reduction strategies is predicted by three sets of online dating concerns-personal security, misrepresentation, and recognition-as well as self-efficacy in online dating. Furthermore, the frequency of uncertainty reduction strategies mediates the relationship between these variables and amount of self-disclosure with potential online dating partners. The authors explore the theoretical implications of these findings for our understanding of uncertainty reduction, warranting, and self-disclosure processes in online contexts. © The Author(s) 2011.","computer-mediated communication; online dating; privacy; self-disclosure; uncertainty reduction theory; warranting",,"Agarwal, R., Sambamurthy, V., Stair, R.M., Research report: The evolving relationship between general and specific computer self-efficacy-an empirical assessment (2000) Information Systems Research, 11, pp. 418-430; Altman, I., Taylor, D.A., (1973) Social Penetration: The Development of Interpersonal Relationships, , New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston; Antheunis, M.L., Valkenburg, P.M., Peter, J., Getting acquainted through social network sites: Testing a model of online uncertainty reduction and social attraction (2010) Computers in Human Behavior, 26, pp. 100-109; Baker, A.J., (2005) Double Click: Romance and Commitment among Online Couples, , Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press; Bandura, A., Self-efficacy: Toward a unifying theory of behavioral change (1977) Psychological Review, 84, pp. 191-215; Bandura, A., Self-efficacy mechanism in human agency (1982) American Psychologist, 37 (2), pp. 122-147; Barnes, S., A privacy paradox: Social networking in the United States (2006) First Monday, 11 (9). , http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue11_9/barnes/index.html, Retrieved September 8, 2007, from; Baron, R.M., Kenny, D.A., The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations (1986) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, pp. 1173-1182; Berger, C.R., Beyond initial interaction: Uncertainty, understanding and the development of interpersonal relationships (1979) Language and Social Psychology, pp. 122-144. , In H.

To help managers make informed decisions, this study compiles a comprehensive overview of strategies to cope with regulatory uncertainty and illustrates their interdependencies and how they can be combined into overall coping postures, as well as offering management guidelines on deciding which to adopt. A literature review identifies a considerable variety of coping strategies, and we apply unique data from a worldwide cross-industry survey to categorize each into one of three types - offensive, defensive or passive. We find that firms aiming to cope with the uncertainty associated with post-Kyoto regulation typically adopt one of four strategic postures, each characterized by a specific combination of these types: 'daredevils' rely solely on offensive strategies; 'coordinators' combine them with defensive ones, 'hedgers' pursue strategies from all three categories while 'gamblers' choose not to specifically cope with uncertainty at all. We exemplify the strategies characteristic of each posture, and illustrate their interdependencies by means of case studies in the European airline industry. We identify two main factors managers should consider particularly when deciding on their firm's strategic posture: the level of regulatory uncertainty they perceive and the firm's exposure to future regulations, and find that the higher the level of uncertainty, the broader the range of strategies applied, and the more future regulation seems likely to affect a firm, the more actively it seeks to cope with the associated uncertainty. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Business activities; Coping strategies; Corporate strategies; Cross industry; European airline industry; Government regulation; Informed decision; Literature reviews; Air transportation; Laws and legislation; Management; Managers; Industry; airline industry; coping strategy; corporate strategy; decision making; firm size; governance approach; strategic approach; uncertainty analysis","(2009) Leaders statement - the global plan for recovery and reform, , For the closing communiqué of the meeting, see G-20, Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, London; Rugman, A.M., Verbeke, A., Environmental policy and international business (2001) Oxford handbook of international business, pp. 537-557. , For a recent review of the increasing regulation of international business with particular focus on environmental policy, see, Oxford University Press, New York, A.M.

It must be obtained from men who know the situation. – Sun Tzu (500 BCE) Introduction A CEO went to Okinawa for the first time. He was on vacation – to see the beaches, to experience the local culture, and to play golf. After the trip, a researcher asked him a question: “How much did the success of your trip depend on your knowledge of the local Japanese context: the language, history, culture, economics and politics?” His answer was: “Gee. Not very much. I had to count local currency, book a hotel room and I even learned a few words of Japanese and it was a good holiday.” A second CEO also went to Okinawa, also for the first time, but with a different objective. He went to buy land, obtain permits, and develop a beachfront hotel and resort. Two years into the project, he was asked the same question and he offered a far more elaborate reply: It was impossible to know all the risks going in. And even the risks that we thought we knew, it didn't mean we knew what to do about them. Our success owes more to our [adaptability] than it does to our ability to predict the risks. And we adapted by making friends with locals and by tapping local knowledge for each key decision … [Local knowledge includes] all manner of facts and trends about the local theatre – about real estate activity, capital markets, city bylaws, building codes, contract protocol, the gray area between the written law and what is enforced.

Literature describes several strategies that can be employed to manage these uncertainties, but this is done in a fragmented way. Therefore, this article aims to develop a comprehensive, coherent and empirically sound classification of uncertainty management strategies. The strategies mentioned in literature can be classified into four categories: ignoring uncertainty; knowledge generation; interaction and coping. A case study of the implementation of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) by Dutch water boards was conducted to test whether the identified strategies are employed in practice. The WFD presents the water boards with uncertainties resulting from the requirements to improve water quality and ecology on one hand, while leaving room to adapt those requirements to regional interests, practices and institutions on the other. The case study confirms the empirical soundness of the classification by revealing that many of the uncertainty management strategies in literature are applied in practice as well. However, further research to test the empirical soundness of the classification in other fields of environmental management is required. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Ambiguity; Regional implementation; Uncertainty; Uncertainty management; Water Framework Directive","article; ecology; Netherlands; policy; priority journal; society; uncertainty; water management; water quality","Arentsen, M.J., Bressers, H.T.A., O'Toole, L.J., Institutional and policy responses to uncertainty in environmental policy: a comparison of Dutch and U.S (2000) Styles Policy Stud.

However, empirical research has produced conflicting results. The results of the present study indicate that environmental uncertainty has a significant negative association with the perceived usefulness of traditional annual budgets, whereas there is no indication of a significant association with flexible budgets. By contrast, there is a significant positive association between accentuation of strategy and appreciation of both types of budget. There is also evidence of a positive association between the perceived usefulness of traditional annual budgets and the perceived usefulness of flexible budgets, supporting prior findings that these budgets are seen more as complements than rivals. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Endogenous Uncertainty; Exogenous Uncertainty; Fixed Budgets, Flexible Budgets; Partial Least Squares (PLS); Real Options; Strategy; Structural Equation Modelling",,"Amram, M., Kulatikala, N., (1999) Real Options.

Furthermore, environmental uncertainty and competitive rivalry could moderate this relationship. This research investigates both questions. Methodology/Approach: The empirical study involves a structured survey of 141 industrial firms. A structural equation technique with EQS 6.1 estimated the causal model. Multi-sample analysis revealed whether environmental uncertainty and/or competitive rivalry act as moderators. Findings: The influence of customer relationship marketing on attitudinal loyalty toward the main supplier is positive but indirect, working through effective communication, satisfaction, and trust. However, when environmental uncertainty is high, the negative direct effect becomes significantly more intense, and when competitive rivalry is high, the positive indirect effect through satisfaction and trust is less intense. Originality/Value: This study explores potential new paths in the relationship marketing field. Most scholars focus on the influence of a firm's relationship marketing strategy on customers' loyalty, but no previous works consider its potential influence on the firm's relationship with other partners in the supply chain, notably its strategic suppliers. Research Implications: Structured academic research on this topic is lacking, even though many firms have implemented customer relationship programs. Supply-side researchers must evaluate the effects of such programs. Furthermore, this study combines different theoretical approaches. Practical Implications: Practitioners can use the findings to segment their customer base and develop specific programs adapted to each target. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Communication; Competitive rivalry; Customer relationship marketing; Environmental uncertainty; Loyalty toward suppliers; Satisfaction; Trust",,"Abdul-Muhmin, A.G., Instrumental and interpersonal determinants of relationship satisfaction and commitment in industrial markets (2005) Journal of Business Research, 58, pp. 619-628; Anderson, E., Weitz, B., Determinants of continuity in conventional industrial channel dyads (1989) Marketing Science, 8 (4), pp. 310-323; Anderson, E., Weitz, B., The use of pledges to build and sustain commitment in distribution channels (1992) Journal of Marketing Research, 29, pp. 18-34. , February; Anderson, H., Havila, V., Salmi, A., Can you buy a business relationship?

This study examined the strategy-performance linkage among small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in China, Turkey, and the United States. The combination strategy-performance linkage was supported in Turkey and the U.S. In China, however, the highest performing strategic group emphasized a focus orientation accompanied by neither cost leadership nor differentiation, and the lowest performing group was comprised of low cost businesses. Findings suggest that managers in all three nations comprehend the concepts of differentiation, cost leadership, and focus, but the means by which these strategic emphases are employed can differ markedly.","China; SME; Turkey","Industry; China; Emerging economies; Low costs; Small to medium-sized enterprise; SME; Strategic groups; Turkey; Uncertainty analysis",,"Parnell, J.A.; Department of Management, School of Business Administration, University of North Carolina at Pembroke, Pembroke, NC 28372, United States; email: John.Parnell@uncp.edu",,"Academy of Management",,,,,"English","Acad.

However, the more realistic RCPSP/max problems - ones where durations of activities are not known with certainty - have received scant interest and hence are the main focus of the paper. Towards addressing the significant computational complexity involved in tackling RCPSP/max with durational uncertainty, we employ a local search mechanism to generate robust schedules. In this regard, we make two key contributions: (a) Introducing and studying the key properties of a new decision rule to specify start times of activities with respect to dynamic realizations of the duration uncertainty; and (b) Deriving the fitness function that is used to guide the local search towards robust schedules. Experimental results show that the performance of local search is improved with the new fitness evaluation over the best known existing approach.

In this contribution, map versions of continuous and categorical data layers are used to establish relationships between map units and the location of 305 water wells with nitrate levels either clearly above a threshold of 25 mg/l (impacted wells), or with wells clearly below that (non-impacted wells). The natural and anthropogenic data layers that are assumed to reflect (a) potential sources of nitrate, and (b) the relative ease with which nitrate may migrate in groundwater, are: population density, nitrogen fertilizer loading, precipitation and irrigation, the protective capacity of soils, land use, vadose zone permeability, groundwater depth, and groundwater velocity. The water wells are separated first into the two groups to locate and recognize sites to be used to map high vulnerabilities using a prediction model based on the empirical likelihood ratio, ELR. Further partitions of the two sub-groups into prediction and validation wells allows setting up blind tests to cross-validate the predictions of relative vulnerability classes (ranks). Prediction-rate tables are obtained and visualized either as histograms or as cumulative proportions of the study area in decreasing order of predicted vulnerability class versus the corresponding relative proportion of impacted validation wells, i.e., not used to predict. Predictions are thus compared and interpreted and repeated predictions are obtained using different sub-sets of prediction and validation wells in the two regions to obtain maps of uncertainty of the prediction classes. The target of the strategy used is not only to assess the goodness of predictions but also to estimate their reliability levels. In this application the uncertainty of the classes in the prediction map happens to be relatively high, which is due to the small number of water wells available in the spatial database. © 2010 WIT Press.","Aquifer vulnerability; Cross-validation; Empirical likelihood ratio; Nitrate concentration; Spatial prediction modeling; Spatial uncertainty","Aquifer vulnerability; Cross validation; Empirical likelihood; Nitrate concentration; Spatial prediction modeling; Spatial uncertainty; Aquifers; Computer simulation; Groundwater resources; Loading; Nitrogen fertilizers; Population statistics; Uncertainty analysis; Water wells; Forecasting","Masetti, M., Poli, S., Sterlacchini, S., The use of the weights-of-evidence modeling technique to estimate the vulnerability of groundwater to nitrate contamination (2007) Natural Resources Research, 16 (2), pp. 109-119; (1991) Council Directive 91/676/EEC of 12 December 1991 Concerning the Protection of Waters Against Pollution Caused By Nitrates From Agricultural Sources, pp. 1-8. , European Community, (Nitrate Directive) OJ L 375, 31.12.1991; Fabbri, A.G., Chung, C.F., On blind tests and spatial prediction models (2008) Natural Resources Research, 17 (2), pp. 107-118; Chung, C.F., Fabbri, A.G., Representation of geoscience data for information integration (1993) Jour of Non-renewable Resources, 2 (2), pp. 122-139; Chung, C.F., Using likelihood ratio functions for modeling the conditional probability of occurrence of future landslide for risk assessment (2006) Computers & Geosciences, 32, pp. 1052-1065; Duda, R.O., Hart, P.E., Nilsson, N.J., Subjective Bayesian methods for rule-based inference systems (1978) Procs.

Prior findings on the relationship between environmental uncertainty, time-based strategy, and business performance have been inconsistent. Meanwhile, the 'strategic planning' dimension of design consultancy firms has not attracted a great deal of attention. Thus, in this paper, we explore the moderating effects of environmental uncertainty on the relationship between time-based strategy and business performance in design firms. Based on data collected from 80 design firms in Taiwan, the findings first reveal that these firms can adopt different time-based strategies to pursue different performance outcomes. Second, the results show that three of four types of environmental uncertainty have direct effects on measures of business performance such as adaptability and innovation. Third, the findings suggest that appropriate matches between environmental uncertainty and time-based strategy can result in superior business performance. Specifically, the results indicate that the design-differentiation preemptor (DDP) strategy is beneficial for a design firm when it comes to achieving superior adaptability in an environment of high-perceived technological evolutions (TE) or competitor movements (CM) uncertainty. In addition, a design firm can adopt the DDP strategy in order to obtain superior levels of innovation in an environment of low-perceived customer demands (CD) uncertainty. However, the findings reveal that there are no moderating effects of environmental uncertainty found with the design-cost follower (DCF) strategy. Last of all, the limitations of this study and future research possibilities are also discussed. © 2010 Sung, Lu, and Ho.","Business performance; Design firm; Environmental uncertainty; Time-based strategy",,"Badri, M.A., Davis, D., Davis, D., Operations strategy, environmental uncertainty and performance: A path analytic model of industries in developing countries (2000) Omega, 28 (2), pp. 155-173; de Mozota, B.B., The four powers of design: A value model in design management (2006) Design Management Review, 17 (2), pp. 44-53; Bourgeois, L.J., Strategic goals, perceived uncertainty and economic performance in volatile environments (1985) Academy of Management Journal, 28 (3), pp. 548-573; Bremser, W.G., Barsky, N.P., Utilizing the balanced scorecard for R&D performance measurement (2004) R&D Management, 34 (3), pp. 229-238; Bruce, M., Bessant, J., (2002) Design In Business: Strategic Innovation Through Design, , Essex, UK: Pearson Education; Calantone, R., Garcia, R., Dröge, C., The effects of environmental turbulence on new product development strategy planning (2003) Journal of Product Innovation Management, 20 (2), pp. 90-103; Chang, S.C., Lin, N.P., Wea, C.L., Sheu, C., Aligning manufacturing capabilities with business strategy: An empirical study in high-tech industry (2002) Journal of Technology Management, 24 (1), pp. 70-87; Chen, J., Reilly, R.R., Lynn, G.S., The impacts of speed-to-market on new product success: The moderating effects of uncertainty (2005) IEEE Transactions On Engineering Management, 52 (2), pp. 199-212; Cheng, J.L.C., Interdependence and coordination in organizations: A role system analysis (1983) Academy of Management Review, 26 (1), pp. 156-162; Chiesa, V., Manzini, R., Pizzurno, E., The externalization of R&D activities and the growing market of product development services (2004) R&D Management, 34 (1), pp. 65-75; Christensen, C.M., (1997) The Innovator's Dilemma: The Revolutionary Book That Will Change the Way You Do Business, , Boston: Harvard Business School Press; Cordero, R., Managing for speed to avoid product obsolescence: A survey of techniques (1991) Journal of Product Innovation Management, 8 (4), pp. 283-294; Daft, R.L., Theory Z: Opening the corporate door for participative management (2004) Academy of Management Executive, 18 (4), pp. 117-121; Daft, R.L., Macintosh, N.B., A tentative exploration into the amount and equivocality of information processing in organizational work units (1981) Administrative Science Quarterly, 26 (2), pp. 207-224; Davis, P.S., Dibrell, C.C., Janz, B.D., The impact of time on the strategy-performance relationship implications for managers (2002) Industrial Marketing Management, 31 (4), pp. 339-349; Dean, T.J., Brown, R.L., Bamford, C.E., Differences in large and small firm responses to environmental context: Strategic implications from a comparative analysis of business formations (1998) Strategic Management Journal, 19 (8), pp. 709-728; Dess, G.G., Beard, D.W., Dimensions of organizational task environments (1984) Administrative Science Quarterly, 29 (1), pp. 52-73; Duncan, R.B., Characteristics of organizational environments and perceived environmental uncertainty (1972) Administrative Science Quarterly, 17 (3), pp. 313-327; Eckersley, M., Spaeth, T., Borsboom, T., Johnston, N.A., Hesse, C., Where is design consulting headed?

The analysis revealed that the designers produced an initial ""first-pass"" solution to the given design brief in a breadth-first manner, with this solution addressing several easy-to-handle requirements. The designers then focused on adding relatively complex-to-handle requirements to this initial solution in what appeared to be a depth-first manner, as reflected, for example, by detailed mental simulations that spanned many transcript segments. Furthermore, such depth-first development of complex requirements was linked to increases in epistemic uncertainty, a finding that supports the predicted role of uncertainty in mediating between complex requirements and depth-first design. Overall these findings support a view of software design as involving a mixed breadth-first and depth-first solution development approach, with strategic switching to depth-first design being triggered by requirement complexity and being mediated by associated feelings of uncertainty. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The Monte Carlo simulation model is used to sample system states according to the failure rates of the system components and a Fuzzy DC OPF model is used to analyse each sampled state. This Fuzzy DC OPF model adopts multi-parametric optimization techniques and admits that loads, generation costs or both of them simultaneously are modeled using fuzzy numbers. At the end of this process, it is possible to compute estimates of the Power Not Supplied and also of the exposure and robustness indices that characterize the ability that the system has to accommodate the specified uncertainties. This information can then be used to characterize the ability each reinforcement has in increasing the robustness of the system. Finally, the paper includes results for two case studies.

Through the correction of the traditional definition of stakeholders I found the general algorithm for achieving robustness in corporate strategies. This algorithm includes: (1) the clear definition of a limited set of the types of stakeholders, (2) the simplification of the sets of stakeholders' claims and discovery of intrinsic benefits common for all stakeholders of a particular type, (3) defining the space of acceptance of corporate performance for each type of stakeholders, (4) finding a non-empty intersection of such spaces for all types of stakeholders. The use of these techniques is illustrated by the new strategy of LUKOIL - one of the major publicly traded oil companies.","Corporate strategies; Robustness; Strategic planning; Uncertainty",,"Dorward, N., Weidemann, P., Robustness as corporate objective function under uncertainty (1981) Managerial and Decision Economics, 2 (3), pp. 186-191; Flueler, T., (2006) Decision Making For Complex Socio-technical Systems: Robustness From Lessons Learned In Long-term Radioactive Waste Governance (environment & Policy), , Dodrecht: Springer; Freeman, R.E., Wicks, A.C., Parmar, B., Stakeholder theory and ""corporate objective revised"" (2004) Organization Science, 15 (3), pp. 364-369; French, S.D., (1988) Decision Theory, An Introduction to The Mathematics of Rationality, , New York: Ellis Horwood and John Wiley; Frooman, J., Stakeholder influence strategy (1999) Academy of Management Review, 24 (2), pp. 191-205; Gurkov, I., Strategy Process as formulation and realization of corporate goals: The synthesis of surveys in Russian firms (2009) Journal For East European Management Studies, 14 (1), pp. 48-64; Hansen, L.P., Sargent, T.J., (2008) Robustness, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; (1991) IEEE Computer Dictionary - Compilation of IEEE Standard Computer Glossaries, , IEEE, 610-1990 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Staff; 01-Jan-1991; Lindgren, M., Bandhold, H., (2003) Scenario Planning: The Link Between Future and Strategy, , New York: Palgrave McMillan, 2003; revised and updated edition, 2009; (2009) LUKOIL Development Strategy: Focus On Value Growth, , http://www.lukoil.com/df.asp?id=43, LUKOIL, December 2009; (2009) OAO LUKOIL.

The analysis of consumers' motives is made through a questionnaire survey on consumers and the method of factor analysis. The research result shows that the purchasing motives of consumers who patronise the store of a retailer who sponsors a sport team during a championship promotional period include both rational and emotional factors. As emotionally supporting factor and advertising and promotional factor are sports-related purchasing motives, the actual result from a sport game could have an impact on consumers' spending.

This aim is achieved by means of presenting the empirical results of an online survey that was undertaken between April and August 2009 with the participation of 140 German agribusiness firms. The majority of respondents expect increasing volatilities and higher prices for agricultural produce. For managing this uncertainty, comparatively simple instruments such as long-term contracts with suppliers or customers are most widely used. But more elaborated instruments to hedge price risks will probably affect the food chain as a whole and will lead to food chain adaptations to volatile markets.","Chain management; Risk management; Strategy; Volatile markets; Volatility",,"Armbruster, W., Challenges and issues in the next decade: A proactive role for agricultural and resource economists (2009) Agricultural and Resource Economics Review, 38 (1); Banse, M.A.H., Helming, J.F.M., Nowicki, P., Meijl, J.C.M., The future of European agriculture after the health check (2008) Agrarwirtschaft: German Journal of Agricultural Economics, 57; Becker, K., Halo effect influences on the Japanese product price/quality relationship (1986) Developments in Marketing Science, , Malhotra, N. and J.

The results of perfect information and the results of investment strategies for decision-making under uncertainty are presented to illustrate the proposed strategies. It also compares the monthly return of strategies to the monthly returns of the money market. In order to find the optimal or best strategy as an effective solution to the portfolio selection problem, different investment strategies are compared over different time horizons. The best strategy is selected by calculating different risk and return (reward) measures that are used as decision criteria. The optimal strategy was the half yearly pessimistic Hurwicz criterion strategy and for the individual funds, S3. The investor does not always have to select the optimal strategy but he can also select a good model.

Only recently, Jakob Bernoulli's plan of a Science of Prediction was resumed by Elart von Collani, who further developed it to a unified theory of uncertainty.

Although numerous studies have documented the positive effects of IT-business alignment on organizational performance, few considered the contextual factors that may influence the relationship. This study attempts to fulfill this gap by investigating the role of environmental uncertainty and business strategy on the performance effects of the strategic alignment. Using survey data and statistical analysis, we show that the positive effect of the strategic alignment is significant only in high uncertainty environments. We also find that these effects on organizational performance vary across business strategies and performance measures. The main contribution of this study is the investigation of strategic alignment-performance relationship with respect to different contextual factors, thus providing a richer insight into IT-business strategic alignment issues.","Business strategy; Environmental uncertainty; IT-business alignment; Organizational performance; Strategic alignment","Business strategy; Contextual factors; Environmental uncertainty; Firm Performance; Organizational performance; Performance effect; Performance measure; Strategic alignment; Survey data; Uncertainty environment; Information systems; Strategic planning; Alignment","Aldrich, H., (1979) Organizations and environments, , Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ; Alter, A.E., CIOs Shift: Focus is on revenue, not on saving money (2005) CIO Insight, , http://www.cioinsight.eom/artide2/0,1540,187525l,00.asp, October 15, 2005.

We assume a dispatcher, who assigns a fleet of vehicles to the set of route of a given single origin-destination pair. As the travel time of each vehicle fluctuates, the average travel time per vehicle becomes uncertain and its moments are determined by the vehicle assignment. In this situation, the dispatcher can achieve a smaller ATT variance without increasing its mean by using mixed strategies rather than pure strategies. We first formulate the mean-variance routing problem, whose solution is the mixed strategy that achieves the smallest variance amongst alternatives whose mean does not exceed a given upper bound. We then show that this problem can be rewritten as a quadratic programming problem using only link-based variables. This enables us to solve the dispatching problem without resorting to exhaustive route enumeration.",,"Average travel time; Dispatching problem; Fleet of vehicles; Mean-variance approach; Origin-destination pairs; Quadratic programming problems; Travel time uncertainty; Vehicle assignment; Fleet operations; Traffic control; Travel time; Vehicles; Problem solving","Bell, M.G.H., Mixed route strategies for the risk-averse shipment of hazardous materials (2006) Networks and Spatial Economics, 6, pp. 253-265; Sen, S., Pillai, R., Joshi, S., Rathi, A.K., A mean-variance model for route guidance in advanced traveler information systems (2001) Transportation Science, 35 (1), pp. 37-49; Sivakumar, R.A., Batta, R., The variance-constrained shortest path problem (1994) Transportation Science, 28 (4), pp. 309-316","Graduate School of Information Systems, University of Electro-Communications, 1-5-1 Chofugaoka, Chofu, Tokyo, 182-8585, Japan",,,,9789889884765,,,"English","Proc.

As the demand for new workers is subject to wide fluctuations, the firm should hire workers in advance and train them. However, the firm should urgently recruit skilled workers from outside the firm due to the shortages in the workforce. Hence, it is important for the firm to design an optimal human resource planning program so as to fulfill the needs of new IT service projects and minimize operation costs, though this involves a trade-off between holding excess workers to prepare for upcoming demand and recruiting experienced workers.

The one discussed here, Hurricane Dean, passed along the south coast of the island in August 2007, damaging crops and disrupting livelihood activities for many small-scale farmers. This study is based on detailed ethnographic research in the southern coastal region of St. Elizabeth parish during the passage of Hurricane Dean, and explores the ways in which small farmers negotiate the stressors associated with hurricane events. The study employed a mix methods approach based on a survey of 282 farming households. The paper documents coping strategies employed by farmers in the immediate period of Hurricane Dean to reduce damage to their farming systems, and highlights the positive correlation between farmers' perceptions of hurricanes and degree of damage to local farming systems. In addition, through an analysis of socio-economic and environmental data, the paper provides an understanding of the determinants of adaptive capacity and strategy among farmers in the area. The study indicated that despite high levels of vulnerability, farmers have achieved successful coping and adaptation at the farm level. © 2009 by the authors.","Adaptive capacity; Coping strategies; Food security; Hurricanes; St. Elizabeth",,"Comfort, L., Wisner, B., Cutter, S., Pulwarty, R., Hewitt, K., Oliver-Smith, A., Fordham, M., Krimgold, F., Reframing disaster policy: the global evolution of vulnerable communities (1999) Environ.

Furthermore, the optimal strategies are calculated with considering the uncertainty of load forecast. In this paper, the parameterized Supply Function Equilibrium (SFE) is employed for modeling the imperfect competition among GENCOs in which proportionate parameterization of the sole and the intercept is used. A pay-as-LMP pricing mechanism is assumed for settling the market and calculating the GENCOs' profits. The fuzzy and probabilistic approaches are utilized for modeling the uncertainty of load forecast. A nine GENCOs test system are used to illustrate the efficiency of these approaches. © 2009 IEEE.","Electricity market; Fuzzy and stochastic demand; Nash equilibrium; Optimal bidding strategy","Complete information; Electricity market; Generating companies; Imperfect competition; Load forecast; Load forecast uncertainty; Nash Equilibrium; Optimal bidding strategy; Optimal strategies; Parameterized; Pricing mechanism; Probabilistic approaches; Stochastic demand; Supply function equilibrium; Test systems; Commerce; Competition; Electric load forecasting; Optimization; Profitability; Stochastic systems; Electric generators","Kirschen, D.S., Strbac, G., (2004) Fundamentals of Power System Economics, , London, U.K, Wiley; Shahidehpour, M., Yamin, H., Li, Z., (2002) Market Operations in Electric Power Systems, , New York, USA: Wiley; Wood, A.J., Wollenberg, B.F., (1996) Power Generation, Operation, and Control, , New York, USA: Wiley; Lai, Y.J., Hwang, C.L., (1992) Fuzzy Mathematical Programming, , Berlin, Germany: Springer-Verlag; David, A.K., Wen, F., Strategic bidding in competitive electricity market: A literature survey (2000) Proc.

Based on a review of the literature on policy formulation, we propose that regulatory uncertainty is characterized by a dependence on political negotiation, a discrete scenario structure, and a discontinuous resolution. Data from a worldwide survey show that firms pursue response strategies to regulatory uncertainty that address these characteristics by participating in policy making and increasing strategic flexibility. Surprisingly, the results also show that regulatory uncertainty only partly causes firms to postpone strategic decisions. We find that existing regulation and a need to act quickly despite regulatory uncertainty are opposed to the pursuit of a postponement strategy. We conclude that improving the mechanisms by which firms participate in early stages of the policy making process could enable them to operate in a more target-oriented manner, allow for more efficient policy implementation, and increase a regulation's effectiveness. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

What are the methods used by conflicting parties to assert their definitions of reality? What role do uncertainties and risks play in these conflicts? How are they treated? What strategies are used by proponents and opponents of a controversial technology to persuade the public and decision-makers? This article aims at finding answers to these questions by looking at technological conflicts from the perspective of the reduction of risks and uncertainty. The lesson drawn from the study of ongoing and past conflicts over controversies in technological development should help to better understand the dynamics of conflicts focused on converging technologies. The reduction of uncertainty is analyzed from the perspective of the sociology of non-knowledge and ignorance. It is argued that new areas of non-knowledge are being created by reducing uncertainty and risks in technological conflicts. © 2009 Interdisciplinary Centre for Comparative Research in the Social Sciences and ICCR Foundation.","Controversies; Ignorance; Non-knowledge; Risk; Technological conflicts; Uncertainty","biotechnology; conflict management; decision making; knowledge; nanotechnology; nuclear power; risk assessment; technological development; theoretical study; uncertainty analysis","Barnes, B., Bloor, D., Henry, J., (1996) Scientific Knowledge: A Sociological Analysis, , London: Athlone; Beck, U., (1988) Gegengifte.

Ignoring the important concept of alignment means that failures in SCM resulting from a mismatch between two or more crucial factors remain common. Accordingly, Lee proposed an environmental uncertainty framework to devise the right SC strategy. However, the proposed framework has thus far remained conceptual. Therefore, this study seeks to empirically investigate Lee's uncertainty framework and examine how alignment between SC strategy and environmental uncertainty impacts perceived SCM performance. Design/methodology/approach: A survey was designed and used to collect 243 usable responses from manufacturers. A profile deviation approach was applied to compute the alignment between SC strategy and environmental uncertainty. Findings: The results of the study verify that the alignment between SC strategy and environmental uncertainty is positively associated with SCM performance. Research limitations/implications: The data were collected from a cross-sectional survey and represented a snapshot of practice. Replication from a longitudinal perspective would better reflect long-term impacts of alignment on SCM performance. Practical implications: Different SC strategies are appropriate for distinct environmental uncertainties. It is not enough to simply form an SC strategy for improving SCM performance without considering the alignment between SC strategies and environmental uncertainties. Originality/value: The study empirically examines Lee's uncertainty framework, which has received considerable attention in relation to SCM, but has not previously been clearly verified. The study also develops the a priori theoretical profiles for SC strategies by using an integrated perspective that incorporates both manufacturing and information system capabilities. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Performance levels; Strategic alignment; Supply chain management",,"Bagozzi, R.P., Yi, Y.K., On the evaluation of structural equation models (1988) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 16, pp. 74-9; Bergeron, F., Raymond, L., Rivard, S., Ideal patterns of strategic alignment and business performance (2004) Information & Management, 41, pp. 1003-20; Brewer, P.C., Speh, T.W., Using the balanced scorecard to measure supply chain performance (2000) Journal of Business Logistics, 21 (1), pp. 75-93; Chan, F.T.S., Performance measurement in a supply chain (2003) International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 21, pp. 534-48; Chan, F.T.S., Qi, H.J., A fuzzy basis channel-spanning performance measurement method for supply chain management (2002) Proceedings of The Institution of Mechanical Engineers Part B: Journal of Engineering Manufacture, 216, pp. 1155-67; Chan, F.T.S., Qi, H.J., Feasibility of performance measurement system for supply chain: A process-based approach and measures (2003) International Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management: Integrated Manufacturing Systems, 14 (3), pp. 179-90; Chan, F.T.S., Qi, H.J., An innovative performance measurement method for supply chain management (2003) Supply Chain Management: An International Journal, 8 (3), pp. 209-23; Chin, W.W., Frye, T.A., PLS-Graph Version 3.0 (1998), Soft Modeling Inc, McLean, VACooper, D.P., Tracey, M., Supply chain integration via information technology: Strategic implications and future trends (2005) International Journal of Integrated Supply Management, 1 (3), pp. 237-57; Dehning, B., Richardson, J.V., Zmud, R.W., The financial performance effects of IT-based supply chain management systems in manufacturing firms (2007) Journal of Operations Management, 25 (4), pp. 806-24; Doty, D.H., Glick, W.H., Huber, G.P., Fit, equifinality, and organizational effectiveness: A test of two configurational theories (1993) Academy Management Journal, 36 (6), pp. 1196-250; Fawcett, S.E., Osterhaus, P., Magnan, G.M., Brau, J.C., McCarter, M.W., Information sharing and supply chain performance: The role of connectivity and willingness (2007) Supply Chain Management: An International Journal, 12 (5), pp. 358-68; Fisher, M., What is the right supply chain for your product?

Analogies were coded for 'purpose' and in terms of whether they were within-domain or between-domain. Mental simulations were coded for 'focus': technical/functional or end-user. All expressions of uncertainty were also identified. Analogies were found to be typically between-domain (indicative of innovative reasoning) and were evenly distributed across solution generation, function finding and explanation. Mental simulations were predominantly technical/functional. Our most striking observation was that analogies and mental simulations were associated with conditions of uncertainty. We propose that analogising and mental simulation are strategies deployed to resolve uncertainty - a claim that is supported by the fact that uncertainty levels returned to baseline values at the end of analogising and simulation episodes. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Dealing with the results of demographic, economic and physical contraction processes and planning for the future of considerably smaller but nevertheless livable cities presents some of the most challenging tasks for urban Europe in the near future. This article highlights the example of Dresden in Eastern Germany, where the breakdown of the state-directed economy caused economic decline, industrial regression, and high unemployment rates. Due to out migration and decreasing birth rates, the city lost 60,000 of its 500,000 residents within one decade. As a consequence, there were housing and office vacancies as well as infrastructure oversupplies. Yet the administrative system was still directed towards growth objectives throughout the 1990s. Only after 2000 this situation changed dramatically. The new strategic plan for Dresden is no longer growth oriented. Instead, it focuses on a model of the compact 'European city', with an attractive urban centre, reduced land consumption, and a stable population. However, in another unexpected turn of events, within the last seven years the city has experienced an unexpected growth of 25,000 residents. Surprisingly, processes of suburbanization have turned into processes of reurbanization. Today in Dresden, areas of shrinkage and decline are in close proximity to prospering and wealthy communities. The strategic challenge is to deal with this patchwork while accepting that the future remains unpredictable. Hence, strategic flexibility becomes more important than the strategy itself. To a certain extent rational analysis and error prevention is displaced by preparedness, robustness, and resilience as key qualifications of planning in shrinking cities.",,"economic growth; planning process; population decline; strategic approach; urban area; urban economy; urban planning; urban population; Central Europe; Dresden; Eurasia; Europe; Germany; Saxony","Allweil, Y., Shrinking cities: Like a slow-motion Katrina (2007) Places, 19 (1), pp. 91-93; Amin, A., Thrift, N., (1994) Globalization, Institutions and Regional Development in Europe, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Beauregard, R.A., (2003) Voices of Decline, The Postwar Fate of US Cities, , Routledge, London/New York; Wegweiser Demographischer Wandel 2020 (2006) Analysen Und Handlungskonzepte Fur Stadte Und Gemeinden, , Stiftung Bertelsmann Bertelsmann Stiftung, Gutersloh; Bontje, M., Facing the challenge of shrinking cities in East Germany: The case of Leipzig (2004) Geojournal, 61, Pp. 13-21., pp. 13-21; Booth, D., Regional long waves and urban policy (1987) Urban Studies, 24, pp. 447-459; Boren, T., Gentile, M., Metropolitan processes in post-communist states: An introduction (2007) Geografiska Annaler Series B: Human Geography, Journal Compilation, Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography, 89 (2), pp. 95-110; Bourne, L., Simmons, J., New fault lines?

Ross School of Business, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, United States; Jiang, L., Department of Logistics, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, Hong Kong","We consider duopoly models where firms make decisions on capacity, production, and price under demand uncertainty. Capacity and price decisions are made, respectively, ex ante and ex post demand realizations. The interplay between the timings of demand realization and production decision endows firms with different capabilities. Flexible firms can postpone production decisions until the actual demand curve is observed, but inflexible firms cannot. Under general demand structures and cost functions, we characterize the equilibrium for a symmetric duopoly and establish the strategic equivalence of price and quantity competitions when firms are flexible. We investigate the stochastic order properties of capacity and profit and show that they both increase for a flexible firm when the market is more volatile. We find that flexibility allows a firm to increase investment in capacity and earn a higher profit while benefiting customers by keeping the price in a narrower range; strategic equivalence implies that these properties are robust to market conjectures. We also show that flexibility plays an important role in mitigating the destructive effect of competition when the demand shock is additive; the destructive effect is nonexistent for firms facing multiplicative demand shock. When flexibility decision is endogenous, a firm's strategic flexibility choice depends on the cost of technology as well as the nature of demand shock. In particular, faced with a multiplicative demand shock, firms always choose to be inflexible, whereas all the possible equilibria are observed under additive demand shocks. © 2008 INFORMS.","Bertrand competition; Cournot competition; Duopoly; Flexibility; Postponement","Bertrand competition; Cournot competition; Duopoly; Flexibility; Postponement; Cost functions; Costs; Competition","Anand, K., Girotra, K., Strategic perils of delayed differentiation under competition (2007) Management Sci, 53 (5), pp. 697-712; Barlow, R.E., Proschan, F., (1965) Mathematical Theory of Reliability, , John Wiley & Sons, New York; Barnes-Schuster, D., Bassok, Y., Anupindi, R., Coordination and Flexibility in supply contracts with options (2002) Manufacturing Service.

By using ethnographic techniques to study the day-to-day practices of strategy making in one firm, I examine the ways actors attempted to transform their own cognitive frames of a situation into predominant frames through a series of interactions. Frames are the means by which managers make sense of ambiguous information from their environments. Actors each had cognitive frames about the direction the market was taking and about what kinds of solutions would be appropriate. Where frames about a strategic choice were not congruent, actors engaged in highly political framing practices to make their frames resonate and to mobilize action in their favor. Those actors who most skillfully engaged in these practices shaped the frame that prevailed in the organization. This framing perspective suggests that frames are not only instrumental tools for the ex post justification of actions taken through power, but rather are an ex ante part of the political process that produces decisions. Uncertainty opens up the possibility for new actors to gain power, and contesting frames is a way of changing the power structures in the organization. A principal contribution of the framing contests model is to locate a middle ground between cognitive and political models of strategy making, one in which frames are both constraints and resources and outcomes can be shaped by purposeful action and interaction to make meaning. © 2008 INFORMS.","Cognition; Cognitive frames; Framing; Politics; Social movements; Strategy as practice; Strategy making; Strategy process",,"Agar, M., (1980) The Professional Stranger.

A review of adaptive management literature and practices reveals several key concepts and principles for adaptive planning: (1) management actions are best understood and practiced as experiments; (2) several plans/experiments can be implemented simultaneously; (3) monitoring of management actions are key; and (4) adaptive management can be understood as 'learning by doing'. The paper identifies various uncertainties in landscape planning as the major obstacles for the adoption of an adaptive approach. To address the uncertainty in landscape planning, an adaptive planning method is proposed where monitoring plays an integral role to reduce uncertainty. The proposed method is then applied to a conceptual test in water resource planning addressing abiotic-biotic-cultural resources. To operationalize adaptive planning, it is argued that professionals, stakeholders and researchers need to function in a genuinely transdisciplinary mode where all contribute to, and benefit from, decision making and the continuous generation of new knowledge.","Adaptive management; Adaptive planning; Monitoring; Transdisciplinarity; Uncertainty; Water resource planning","adaptive management; decision making; ecosystem management; environmental management; environmental monitoring; environmental planning; landscape planning; resource management; uncertainty analysis; water planning","Ahern, J., Spatial concepts, planning strategies, and future scenarios: A framework method for integrating landscape ecology and landscape planning (1999) Landscape Ecological Analysis: Issues and Applications, pp. 175-201. , Springer-Verlag, New York; Aldridge, C.L., Boyce, M.S., Baydack, R.K., Adaptive management of prairie grouse: How do we get there?

Our study finds that (1) an organizational capability of stakeholder integration is associated with a service firm's adoption of a proactive environmental strategy; (2) an uncertain business environment has a direct positive influence and a complex business environment has a direct negative influence on a firm's environmental strategy; and (3) complexity has a negative moderating influence on the relationship between a firm's stakeholder integration capability and its environmental strategy. © 2007 British Academy of Management.",,,"Agle, R.B., Mitchell, R.K., Sonnenfeld, J.A., Who matters to CEOs?

Scales were developed to measure managers' openness to strategic change, involvement of others, formality of strategic control, type of data used in strategic analysis, and strategic planning time horizon. Responses from 207 managers (50 Americans, 43 Malaysians, 70 Thai, and 44 Turkish) were analyzed using ANOVA. The findings indicated that UA had minimal influences on the managers' approach, as different managers from cultures with varied degrees of UA demonstrated noticeable similarities among the five variables investigated. Practical implications as well as suggestions for future research were provided. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The moderating effects of three variables are considered: the use of behavior based coordination strategy; the perceived level of environmental uncertainty; and the use of collaborative communication strategy. Design/methodology/approach - The hypotheses are tested through a sample survey among 101 channel partners of mobile service providers in a state in India. Findings - The results indicate the moderating variables act as quasi moderators wherein they both directly and indirectly impact the dependent variable. Research limitations/implications - Limitations of the sampling methodology and sample size restricts the scope for generalizing the hypothesis. Further, data were collected from only one side of the dyad. Originality/value - The paper endorses and attempts to establish the view that channel satisfaction is a multidimensional concept and there are different routes to channel commitment. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Channel relationships; Distribution channels and markets; India",,"Abdul-Muhmin, A.G., Instrumental and interpersonal determinants of relationship satisfaction and commitment in industrial markets (2005) Journal of Business Research, 58 (5), pp. 619-28; Achrol, R.S., Stern, L.W., Environmental determinants of decision-making uncertainty in marketing channels (1988) Journal of Marketing Research, 25, pp. 36-50; Achrol, R.S., Reve, T., Stern, L.W., The environment of marketing channel dyads: A framework for comparative analysis (1983) Journal of Marketing, 47, pp. 55-67; Andaleeb, S.S., Dependence relations and the moderating role of trust: Implications for behavioural intentions in marketing channels (1995) International Journal of Research in Marketing, 12 (2), pp. 157-72; Anderson, E., Lodish, L.M., Weitz, B., Resource allocation behaviour in conventional channels (1987) Journal of Marketing Research, 24 (1), pp. 85-97; Anderson, J.C., Gerbing, D.W., Structural equations modeling in practice: A review and recommended two step approach (1988) Psychological Bulletin, 103 (3), pp. 411-23; Aiken, L., West, S.G., (1991) Multiple Regression: Testing and Interpreting Interactions, , Sage London; Bagozzi, R.P., (1980) Causal Models in Marketing, , Wiley New York, NY; Bagozzi, R.P., Philips, L.W., Representing and testing organisational theories: A holistic approach (1982) Administrative Science Quarterly, 27 (3), pp. 459-89; Baron, R.M., Kenny, D.A., The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic and statistical considerations (1986) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, pp. 1173-82; Bentler, P.M., Bonett, D.G., Significant tests and goodness of fit in the analysis of covariance structures (1980) Psychological Bulletin, 88, pp. 588-606; Celly, K.S., Frazier, G.L., Outcome-based and behaviour-based coordination efforts in channel relationships (1996) Journal of Marketing Research, 33 (2), pp. 200-10; Cohen, J., Cohen, P., (1983) Applied Multiple Regression/Correlation Analysis for the Sciences, , 2nd ed.

Evaluation methods for this purpose are described for two cases; one in which the decision-maker can (climate risk case) and cannot (climate uncertainty case) assign probabilities to future climate change scenarios. Fuzzy sets are used to characterize uncertainty regarding both future climate change, and the conditional outcomes of adaptive strategies. The preferred conditional adaptive strategy for a future climate change scenario is determined by ordering the adaptive strategies for that scenario using a fuzzy set operation. Two methods are described for determining the adaptive strategy that is preferred across all climate change scenarios. The preferred overall adaptive strategy for the climate risk case is determined by maximizing a performance index for strategies. The preferred overall adaptive strategy for the climate uncertainty case is determined using the minimax regret criterion, which selects the strategy that minimizes the maximum loss in performance that can occur across all strategies and climate change scenarios. Ways for making the evaluation methods dynamic are considered. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.","Adaptive strategies; Climate change; Risk; Uncertainty","climate change; ecosystem management; policy making; risk assessment; strategic approach","Ackerman, F., Stanton, E., (2006) Climate Change-the Costs of Inaction, , http://www.ase.tufts.edu/gdae/Pubs/rp/Climate-CostsofInaction.pdf, Report to Friends of the Earth England, Wales and Northern Ireland Cited 26 October 2006; Allen, M., Raper, S., Mitchell, J., Climate change-uncertainty in the IPCC's Third Assessment Report (2001) Science, 293, pp. 430-433; Arthur, L.M., Van Kooten, G.C., Climatic impacts on the agribusiness sectors of a prairie economy (1992) Prairie for, 17, pp. 97-109; Barrett, C.R., Pattanaik, P.K., Fuzzy sets, preference and choice: Some conceptual issues (1989) Bull Econ Res, 41, pp. 229-253; Bass, S.M., Kwakernaak, H., Rating and ranking of multiple-aspect alternatives using fuzzy sets (1977) Automatica, 13, pp. 47-58; Bellman, R.E., Zadeh, L.A., Decision-making in a fuzzy environment (1970) Manage Sci, 17, pp. 141-B164; Berrens, R.P., Brookshire, D.S., McKee, M., Schmidt, C., Implementing the safe minimum standard approach (1998) Land Econ, 74, pp. 147-161; Bishop, R.C., Endangered species and uncertainty: The economics of a safe minimum standard (1978) Am J Agri Econ, 60, pp. 10-18; Bryant, C.R., Smit, B., Brklacich, M., Johnston, T.R., Smithers, J., Singh, B., Adaptation in Canadian agriculture to climate variability and change (2000) Clim Change, 45, pp. 181-201; Carlsson, C., Fuller, R., Fuzzy multiple criteria decision making: Recent developments (1996) Fuzzy Sets Syst, 78, pp. 139-153; Castle, E., Adamowicz, W., Boxall, P., Luckert, M., Phillips, W., White, W., Pluralism and pragmatism in the pursuit of sustainable development (1996) Forestry, Economics and the Environment, pp. 1-9. , CAB International Wallingford, United Kingdom; Ciriacy-Wantrup, S.V., (1952) Resource Conservation: Economics and Policies, , University of California Press, Berkeley California; (2005) Uncertainty in Analyzing Climate Change: Policy Implications, , Congressional Budget Office Washington, DC; Dessai, S., Hulme, M., (2003) Does Climate Policy Need Probabilities?

Uncertainty reduction theory has identified four strategies for the visitors to lower their uncertainty. Since different Internet strategies have different efficiency and effectiveness at conveying different levels of information, and not all tasks have the same information need, the relative effectiveness of these technologies at supporting these strategies to reduce uncertainty is still unclear. This research designs two laboratory experiments to investigate how the initial visitors will use different types of uncertainty-reducing technological support, how different task types and different levels of presented information would lead to greater uncertainty reduction. The results would inform practitioners on how these strategies could be useful to reduce uncertainty surrounding new online stores, and ultimately to promote Internet commerce. © 2007 IEEE.","Information level; Task type; Technology support; Uncertainty reduction","Human computer interaction; Online systems; User interfaces; Web services; Information level; Task type; Technology support; Uncertainty reduction; Internet","Berger, C.R., Communicating under Uncertainty (1987) Interpersonal Processes, pp. 39-62. , M.

Following the evacuation of New Orleans, surveys were administered to those individuals displaced by Katrina and relocated to shelters or in Disaster Centers in Cape Cod, Massachusetts; Lansing, Michigan; different parts of Indiana and Kentucky; and federal aid distribution centers throughout Texas. Results indicated that talking, staying informed, and praying emerged as predictors of changes in psychological stress during relocation. Differences emerged in coping strategies based on gender, race, and income; however, age did not emerge as a factor.

In recent years, many companies have come to recognize the important role supply chain purchasing strategy plays in achieving competitive advantage. One of the key components of the supply chain purchasing strategy is supplier development. In addition, there have been calls for research into how changes in supply chain management affect the use of MAS. Design/methodology/approach - About 78 managers from different organizations participated in this Finnish study. Using operations management and accounting literature, four hypotheses were proposed in the study. Data were collected from managers using a mail-out questionnaire. Findings - The results revealed that PEU is a determinant of SUD, which, in turn, is a determinant of the use of MAS. In other words, SUD plays a mediating role in the relationship between PEU and the use of broad scope MAS information. Research limitations/implications - This paper describes the responses from 78 managers in medium to large size manufacturing firms in North-Western Finland and consequently a caveat about generalizability is appropriate notwithstanding the high-global esteem of Finnish manufacturing. Practical implications - The competitive production environment that exists today has forced many firms into lean production. This paper suggests that under such conditions of uncertainty the incorporation of SUD data into the MAS may prove very salutary. Originality/value - The findings of this paper should prove useful to firms entertaining an upgrade and broadening the scope of their MAS to include supply chain management information, particularly as it relates to supplier development.","Accounting systems; Finland; Management accounting; Supplier relations",,"Abernethy, M.A., Lillis, A.M., ""The impact of manufacturing flexibility on management control system design"" (1995) Accounting, Organization, and Society, 20 (4), pp. 241-258; Bagozzi, R.P., Yi, Y., ""On the evaluation of structural equation models"" (1988) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 16 (1), pp. 74-94; Baron, R.M., Kenny, D.A., ""The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic and statistical considerations"" (1986) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, pp. 1173-1182; Berger, P., Gerstenfeld, A., Zeng, A.Z., ""How many suppliers are best?

The first part of the paper shows how, in a context of population growth and frequent subsistance crises, urban authorities strive to extend their control over food supply, prices and the quality of food products, in order to reduce uncertainty and to protect consumers. However, this institutionalization process is slow and imperfect: the second part of this article deals with the way in which some institutions and rules, which are precisely created to clarify the conditions of exchange, are occasionnally diverted from this first aim by economic actors and therefore contribute paradoxically to blur market information. The third section of the paper finally explores the various kinds of economic rationality and shows how, in contexts of rare and imperfect economic information, some actors precisely take benefits from this uncertainty by using social links and networks to their best advantage.",,,"LEVI, G., (1985) L'eredità immateriale.

For repeated shipments where there is complete uncertainty about link incident probabilities, it is shown that the safest strategy is in general to use a mix of routes. Starting with a simple two-route example, it is shown that maximum exposure can be significantly reduced by sharing shipments between routes. In order to determine the safest set of routes and the safest share of traffic between these routes, a minmax problem is formulated which considers both the loss in the event of an incident and shipment (travel) cost. Connections to game theory provide useful insights into the nature of the solution. The properties of the optimality conditions are explored leading to the formulation of an equivalent linear programming problem. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Game theory; Hazardous materials; Uncertainty",,"Abkowitz, M., Lepofsky, M., Cheng, P., Selecting criteria for designating hazardous materials highway routes (1992) Transp Res Rec, 1333, pp. 30-35; Ahuja, R.K., Magnanti, T.L., Orlin, J.B., Network Flows: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications (1993) Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, , Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ; Associates, A., (1994) Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, , ALK’s PC*HazRoute (Version 2.0).

In order to have profit a firm must pursue strategies of cooperation while outsourcing business processes. Strategic interdependence between the client and the provider firms has led us to look into the maneuverability of one structure by the other. The client firm in order to de-risk its business from risks generated by its own structure outsources part of the business. The structure of the outsourced partner, described sometimes as the extended enterprise, together with the structure of its client generate endogenous demand for outsourcing. Structures are the sources of demand here. Boundaries of the two structures become fuzzy, and transactions in intermediate outsourced goods shift the management of coordination between the two firms to a novel platform. Now each firm forms an expectation on what the counterparty expects, and through this the parties evolve norm. Norm based transaction leads to uncertainty and this uncertainty is the source of an entrepreneurial profit.

This study addresses the following research questions: Do differences exist between levels of perceived environmental change/uncertainty and users of middle-up-down and top-down strategy implementation approaches? And, does this relationship become more meaningful when ownership, firm structure and foodservice segment characteristics are considered? There has been very little research on the food service industry that assesses the relationship between eleven task environment measures of complexity and dynamism and the use of a predominately top-down or middle-up-down approach to the implementation of strategies. Using a sample of food industry managers, multiple discriminate analysis (MDA) was used to predict the use of implementation strategies. Substantive differences appear to exist between levels of perceived environmental change/uncertainty and users of middle-up-down and top-down strategy implementation approaches for foodservice firms. The ability to correctly classify users of middle-up-down and top-down approaches using a multivariate combination of environmental variables is improved radically when ownership, firm structure, and market segment classifications were are considered. Taken as a whole, the findings are most convincing and support the basic hypotheses. Study findings indicate that a broad brushstroke approach to determining whether a middle-up-down or top-down is used or appropriate based on the perceived task environment may not be valuable. The results support previous findings in other industries in that the prediction is better for market segments served and the public versus private nature of the firms involved.","Change; Foodservice; Implementation; Middle-up-down; Top-down; Uncertainty",,"Ashmos, D.P., Duchon, D., McDaniel Jr., R.R., Huonker, J.W., What a mess/Participation as a simple managerial rule to complexify organizations (2002) Journal of Management Studies, 39, pp. 189-206; Barringer, B.R., Bluedorn, A.C., The relationship between corporate entrepreneurship and strategic management (1999) Strategic Management Journal, 20, pp. 421-444; Benson, M., Crime and the life course (2001), Los Angles: RoxburyBourgeois III, L.J., Brodwin, D.R., Strategic implementation: Five approaches to an elusive phenomenon (1984) Strategic Management Journal, 5, pp. 241-264; Bradach, J.L., Using the plural form in the management of restaurant chains (1997) Administrative Science Quarterly, 42 (2), pp. 276-303; Brews, P.J., Hunt, M.R., Learning to plan and planning to learn: Resolving the planning school/ learning school debate (1999) Strategic Management Journal, 20, pp. 889-913; Bryson, J.M., Bromiley, P., Critical factors affecting the planning and implementation of major products (1993) Strategic Management Journal, 14, pp. 319-337; Cloudhury, V., Sampler, J.L., Information specificity and environmental scanning: An economic perspective (1997) Management Information Systems Quarterly, 21, pp. 25-53; Dillman, D.A., (2000) Mail and Telephone Surveys: The Total Design Method, , 2nd Ed.

However, there is far less understanding of the role of regulatory uncertainty resulting from environmental policy. Furthermore, industry-specific effects are only little understood. Most studies focus on one industry only or analyze companies from multiple industries without explicitly analyzing industry effects. Drawing from the literature on environmental uncertainty, institutional theory, and the resource-based view of the firm, we propose that first, the level of perceived state uncertainty, and second, the impact of regulatory pressure on environmental strategies are industry-specific. We further propose that a high impact from regulatory pressure on environmental strategy is associated with a high level of perceived state uncertainty. We test our hypotheses on a sample of 85 companies affected by the European Emission Trading Scheme. Furthermore, our study shows the usefulness of combining institutional theory with the resource-based view as the two theories complement each other from an internal and external perspective of an organization.","Climate change; Environmental strategy; Pollution regulation","Emission trading scheme; Environmental policy; Environmental strategy; Environmental uncertainty; High impact; Industry effects; Institutional theory; Pollution regulation; Regulatory pressure; Resource-based view; Resource-based view of the firm; Technological change; Climate change; Environmental management; Environmental protection; Environmental regulations; Industry","Aragón-Correa, J.A., Strategic proactivity and firm approach to the natural environment (1998) Academy of Management Journal, 41 (5), pp. 556-567; Aragón-Correa, J.A., Sharma, S., A contingent resource-based view of proactive corporate environmental strategy (2003) Academy of Management Review, 28 (1), pp. 71-88; Barney, J.B., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage (1991) Journal of Management, 17 (1), pp. 99-120; Christmann, P., Effects of ""best practices"" of environmental management on cost advantage: The role of complementary assets (2000) Academy of Management Journal, 43 (4), pp. 663-680; Dimaggio, P., Powell, W., The iron cage revisited: Institutional isomorphism and collective rationality in organizational fields (1983) American Sociological Review, 48 (2), pp. 147-160; Ettlie, J.E., Organizational policy and innovation among suppliers to the food processing sector (1983) Academy of Management Journal, 26 (1), pp. 27-44; Gagelmann, F., Frondel, M., The impact of emission trading on innovation - Science fiction or reality?

Design/methodology/approach - The knowledge of supply chain uncertainty is collected from previous research performed under enterprise resource planning (ERP)-controlled manufacturing environments. The knowledge is used as the input for TAPS and is mapped to investigate and formulate appropriate business strategy and action plan to manage supply chain uncertainty in such environments. Findings - The results of knowledge translation provide a set of guidelines to academics and practitioners, which indicates the underlying causes of supply chain uncertainty in ERP-controlled manufacturing environments in a priority order, and the suitable business strategy and actions that could potentially be adopted to manage the uncertainty. Practical implications - Owing to the increasing level of complexity and uncertainty intoday's enterprises, translating knowledge is suggested to be useful in assisting decision making and business strategy formulation. Originality/value - This research provides a successful case example of knowledge translation process of supply chain uncertainty into business strategy and actions, which enables creation of sustainable strategies to manage uncertainty based on the concept of knowledge management and learning. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Decision making;

Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected from 158 US and 66 Hong Kong Chinese companies concerning the extent to which these companies engaged in training and development, monitoring and assessment of employee performance, and staffing through an internal labor market. Data were also obtained concerning the uncertainty in the supply of qualified employees. Findings – After controlling differences in industries and company size, the results show that, when faced with labor uncertainty, use of the three (HRM) strategies was increased by Hong Kong Chinese companies, but decreased by US companies. Practical implications – This study provides new information about how cultural differences may play out in business organizations. The results may provide some insight into how competitors in a global marketplace may react to environmental uncertainties and greater resource dependence. Originality/value – This study fills a need to understand how organizations operating different cultural contexts differ in their reactions to uncertainties in the business environment. © 2006, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Hong Kong; Human resource management; Labour market; Uncertainty management; United States of America",,"Bae, J., Lawler, J., Organizational and HRM strategies in Korea: impact on firm performance in an emerging economy (2000) Academy of Management Journal, 43 (3), pp. 502-517; Baron, J., Jennings, P.D., Dobbin, F., Mission control?

Box 5500, FI-02015 Hut, Finland","The extant literature on the focused factory has not explored the contingencies associated with the de facto adoption and use of focused factory principles: Why are some plants focused while others are not? Is focus - or unfocus - a strategic choice, best practice or perhaps a reflection of an environmental constraint? In his pioneering work, Skinner [W. Skinner, 1974. The focused factory. Harvard Business Review 52 (3), 113-121] prescribes companies to ensure that the manufacturing task of their manufacturing units is simple and focused, for instance, by assigning a narrow product mix for each factory or concentrating on a narrow mix of production technologies. Especially in the absence of compelling empirical evidence on the effectiveness of the focused factory approach, we argue that we still do not understand why some plants may remain unfocused. We observe that in the international process industry case examined in this paper, some factories are unfocused and their manufacturing tasks are all but simple. Yet, some of them appear to be high performers. This presents an opportunity to seek empirical insight on the questions raised above. Specifically, we examine why manufacturing companies in the process industries may or may not follow the focused factory strategy. Our results suggest that in certain operating environments and with certain competitive strategies, choosing not to focus the manufacturing task should be viewed as a viable alternative manufacturing strategy, perhaps even a constraint imposed by the operating environment. We develop four contingency propositions to explain why focused manufacturing strategy may not be desirable or even possible. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The results indicate that customers realize different performance benefits from relational exchanges in certain versus uncertain environments. In uncertain environments, all the customer performance benefits tested were enhanced through the use of relational exchanges, but in more certain environments, only the production performance benefits achieved through knowledge transfer were improved. The results suggest the need to develop exchange theory and conduct further research on the influences of both environmental and internal organization uncertainty on relational customer-supplier exchanges and the corresponding performance benefits. © 2006 M.E.

Assessing this environment provides insight into the unique changes, the implications these changes have on a firm's strategies, and the creation of special techniques required to understand them. One of these special techniques is scenario planning. Any study of the relationship between strategy, environment and performance must include variables that involve business scope and resource commitments. Design/methodology/approach - A review of the research literature on the use and benefits of both the traditional approaches and the scenario approach to constructing the future strategy of a firm in a changing environment is undertaken. Findings - The results suggest that a better understanding of the performance of firms within a changed environment can be achieved using the combination of a PESTEL analysis, internal resource analysis and the use of scenarios. This reformulation equation creates a model of a possible environment in which the firm must operate and an investigation of the strategic implications of various scenarios to the firm. Originality/value - This paper is unique in that it marries the traditional approaches to strategy development with the application of scenario planning. It is of benefit to managers and strategic planners by illustrating how a firm may better develop insight into how it should formulate and implement its strategy in order to retain or create a competitive advantage in the changed environment in which it operates. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate strategy; Organizational change",,"Baden-Fuller, C., Volberda, W., ""Strategic renewal: How large complex organizations prepare for the future"" (1997) International Studies of Management & Organization, 27 (2), pp. 95-120; Boeker, W., ""Strategic change: The effects of founding and history"" (1989) Academy of Management Journal, 32 (3), pp. 489-515; Boeker, W., ""Strategic change: The influence of managerial characteristics and organizational growth"" (1997) Academy of Management Journal, 40 (1), pp. 152-170; Chwalowski, M., ""Predicting success after deregulation: An evaluation of airline, trucking and telecommunication firms"" (1997) Issues and Trends Briefing Paper, , No. 76, EEI, January; Corsi, R.D., ""The effects of LTL motor carrier size on strategy and performance"" (1992) Logistics and Transportation Review, 28 (2), p. 129; Day, G.S., (1990) Market Driven Strategy: Processes for Creating Value, , The Free Press/Macmillan Inc., New York, NY; Eisenhardt, K.M., Bourgeois III, L.J., ""Politics of strategic decision making in high velocity environments: Toward a midrange theory"" (1988) Academy of Management Journal, 31 (4), pp. 737-770; Epstein, J.H., ""Scenario planning: An introduction"" (1998) The Futurist, 32 (6), pp. 50-55; Fahey, L., ""Scenario learning"" (2000) Management Review, pp. 29-34. , March; Fahey, L., Randall, R.M., ""What is scenario learning?""

As companies attempt to create this integrated environment, two important questions emerge. Does a high level of internal integration lead to a higher level of external integration? In the context of product development, this study considers whether internal integration in the form of concurrent engineering practices affects the level of external integration as manifested by customer integration, supplier product integration, and supplier process integration. External integration, in turn, may influence competitive capabilities, namely product innovation performance and quality performance. Second, using contingency theory, do certain contextual variables moderate the linkages between integration strategy (external and internal) and performance? Specifically, this study considers whether uncertainty, equivocality, and platform development strategy change the relationships among internal integration, external integration, and competitive capabilities. Data collected from 244 manufacturing firms across several industries were used to test these research questions. The results indicate that both internal and external integration positively influence product innovation and quality and ultimately, profitability. With respect to contingency effects, the results indicate that equivocality moderates the relationships between integration and performance.","Contingency theory; Integration; New product development; Structural equation modeling",,"Anderson, J.C., Gerbing, D.W., Hunter, J.E., On the assessment of unidimensional measurement: Internal and external consistency, and overall consistency criteria (1987) Journal of Marketing Research, 24 (NOVEMBER), pp. 432-437; Barkan, P., Productivity in the process of product development - An engineering perspective (1992) Integrating Design for Manufacturing for Competitive Advantage, pp. 56-68. , G.

These challenges associated with uncertainty are both complex and significant. In this paper, it is proposed to de-define uncertainty as a reference to situations in which people experience, or construct doubt, on something that matters in view of decision-making and acting, which is made possible, because (scientific) knowledge is perceived or portrayed as limited. The second part of the paper is about dealing with uncertainty. The scholarly focus so far has been on methodology to accommodate uncertainty. Another way is to empirically research logics, manners and strategies actually adopted in dealing with uncertainty.

Friedman, S. Dunwoody, and C.L. Rogers (Eds) Mahwah, USA: Lawrence Erlbaum Associated; In this paper ‘uncertainty’ is used as an umbrella notion. Some would prefer ‘ignorance’ (Smithson, 1989, 1993; Stocking, 1998), ‘incertitude’ (Harremoes, 2002) or ‘non-knowledge’ (Hilgartner, 2003) as a coordinating term as they consider such notions more symmetrical to complement the language of knowledgeI take the term ‘science for policy’ as a very broad reference to all kind of contexts in which scientific knowledge and expertise is used, produced and co-produced for policy purposes‘Risk analysis’ is used here as an umbrella term encompassing all efforts to identify, assess, evaluate and manage risksWe have analysed the so-called Pfizer case, i.e. a case on the risks of the use of antibiotics as growth promoter in meat production. In ‘managing’ this risk, both a committee of scientists, the European Commission and the European Council and the European Court of First Instance were involvedFor research on the topic of how uncertainty is dealt with by climate change experts, see, for example, Heal and Kristrom (2002), Petersen (in prep.), van Aardenne (2002), van der Sluijs (1997) and van der Sluijs et al. (1998)e.g. Bailey et al. (1996), Friedman et al. (1999), Funtowicz and Ravetz (1990), Harremoes (2003), Heal and Kristrom (2002), Jager (1998), Klinke and Renn (2002), Morgan (2003), Morgan and Henrion (1990), O’Riordan and McMichael (2002), Pahl-Wostl et al. (1998), Pollack (2003), Ravetz (1997), Stocking (1998), van Asselt and Petersen (2003), van Asselt and Rotmans (1996, 2002), van der Sluijs (1997), Walker and Marchau (2003) and Walker et al. (2003)We could even argue that without the context of risk, ‘uncertainty’ is just a scholastic worry (Ravetz, personal communication, January 2004)This description of the problem of uncertainty is inspired by Souren (2003) (firm ground) and van der Sluijs (2004) (quicksand)From Bovens and ‘t Hart (1996) empirically informed reasoning about policy fiascoes, we can conclude that, in retrospect, error and crisis may be attributed to old decisions or acts in situations enveloped in uncertaintyIt may seem straightforward as a standard report often reconstructs the (risk) analysis according to a linear logic (Dunsby, 2004)For references, see Note 6See, for example, Slob (1994) who discussed this danger in relation to Monte Carlo analysis. Fosket (2004) describes how a breast cancer model that remained uncertain and controversial, has become the standard tool, the ‘right tool for the job’The notion of ‘search light’ is inspired by Bal et al. (2002)I have contributed myself to efforts to define uncertainty through such typologies (see, for example, van Asselt (2000), van Asselt and Rotmans (2002) and Walker et al. (2003)), and I still hold that such typologies are helpful in the methodological perspective, as is illustrated by, for example, Krayer von Kraus et al. (2004, forthcoming), van Asselt et al. (2001b) and van der Klis (2003)Social studies of science portray science as a social process of knowledge construction. For further references see the journals Social Studies of Science and Science, Technology and Human Values. Introductions can be found in Biagioli (1999), Bijker et al. (1987), Hess (1999), Jasanoff et al. (1995) and Latour and Woolgar (1986)For an overview of the management literature on ambiguity see Noordegraaf (2000)For other publications on my research on foresight practice, see van Asselt (2000, 2004) and van Asselt et al. (2001a,b, 2003)For more details see the section below on acknowledgement of uncertainty‘Effective’ is used here as a reference to whether they manage to act or to proceed, not as a qualification of the act or the process itself. It may well be that some manners and strategies in use can be disqualified as effective from the perspective of a normative idea on how uncertainty should be dealt with. The review in this paper is a descriptive endeavour, not a normative evaluationInterestingly enough, Dunsby (2004) observes that although ‘worst case scenario’ is an adequate description of what they are putting into practice, ‘this language is generally avoided’. Unfortunately, Dunsby (2004) does not indicate why this language is avoidedBoth Dunsby (2004) and Fosket (2004) also bring also an issue to the fore, which can also be found in the research of uncertainty scholars such as Keepin and Wynne (1984), Schneider (1997), Shackley and Wynne (1995), van Aardenne (2002), van Asselt and Rotmans (1996, 2002) and van der Sluijs (1997), i.e. that immeasurable factors and uncertainty often cannot be incorporated in models, with the consequence that these uncertain issues are omitted when the model is used as a base. Furthermore, Fosket (2004) warns that: ‘‘This is not to say that such inclusion [of factors omitted, mva] would make it a better model but to emphasise that a model today would be just as much an artefact of its context and would surely leave factors out that, in the future, we will recognise as risks’’and she points to ‘an inevitable problematic of trying to model based on unstable and constantly shifting knowledge and a particular historical moment in our understanding’. However, in the current paper, I am interested in how models are mobilised to deal with uncertainty, not how models may fall short in addressing uncertaintyThe EC and GC scenarios are two scenarios developed by the Dutch Economic Planning Bureau (CPB, 1997).

The ship operator’s decision is framed as an option to exchange the risky income stream of one strategy (asset) for the maximum of several alternatives as uncertainty is resolved over time. Copeland’s and Antikarov’s Marketable Asset Disclaimer is invoked; the intrinsic values of the underlying assets and their volatilities and correlations are modelled using traditional discounted cash flow techniques. The option is valued numerically in a multinomial tree. The result is the value of flexibility and is added to the present value of the original strategy to derive the present value of the flexible strategy. A sensitivity analysis is performed to examine the value of the flexible strategy as both the levels of uncertain factors and their volatilities change. © 2005 Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.

Under resource constraints, the government needs to carefully select a design strategy so as to cope with uncertainty and achieve its objective(s). Through sensitivity analyses, this paper discusses the social and financial aspects of three government's network design strategies, namely government-as-the-provider (GP), monopoly market (MM), and competitive market (CM). The first is the government acts as the sole toll road operator who provides the infrastructure but collects just enough tolls to recover costs. The second is the private sector builds all the toll roads based on the build-operate-transfer scheme and collects tolls in a monopoly manner. The third is the government allows multiple operators to build different toll roads but collect tolls under the build-operate-transfer scheme in a competitive manner. The results show that even though the GP strategy would produce the best total discounted consumer surplus (TDCS), maintaining cost recovery might be a problem. On the other hand, the MM strategy would mostly likely be profitable to the operators, at the expense of producing a much lower TDCS. It appears that the CM strategy would maintain a good balance between TDCS and profitability under uncertainty. This finding is consistent with the current trend of privatizing government services to multiple companies. © 2005 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Build-operatetransfer; Network improvements financing; Time-dependent transport network design; Transport projects",,"Boyce, D.E., Janson, B.N., A discrete transportation network design problem with combined trip distribution and assignment (1980) Transportation Research, 14B, pp. 147-154; Chen, M.Y., Alfa, A.S., A network design algorithm using a stochastic incremental traffic assignment approach (1991) Transportation Science, 25, pp. 215-224; Davis, G.A., Exact local solution of the continuous network design problem via stochastic user equilibrium assignment (1994) Transportation Research, 28B, pp. 61-75; Friesz, T.L., Anandalingam, G., Mehta, N.J., Nam, K., Shah, S.J., Tobin, R.L., The multiobjective equilibrium network design problem revisited: A simulated annealing approach (1993) European Journal of Operational Research, 65, pp. 44-57; Han, D., Lo, H., (2004) Solving Nonadditive Traffic Assignment Problems: A Decent Method for Co-Coercive Variational Inequalities, , European Journal of Operational Research, in press; Leblanc, L.J., An algorithm for discrete network design problem (1975) Transportation Science, 9, pp. 183-199; Lo, H., Szeto, W.Y., Time-dependent transport network design: A study of budget sensitivity (2003) Journal of the Eastern Asia Society for Transportation Studies, 5, pp. 1124-1139; Lo, H., Szeto, W.Y., Planning transport network improvements over time (2004) Urban and Regional Transportation Modeling: Essays in Honor of David Boyce, pp. 157-176. , Lee, D.H.

These payments relate to specified completion points.

In general, it investigates the role of the choice of performance measures on the relationship between (a) strategic priorities and performance and (b) environmental uncertainty and performance. Two hypotheses are developed concerning this general relationship, predicting, respectively, a positive relationship between business unit strategy and performance through management's choice of non-financial measures of performance (H1) and a positive relationship between environmental uncertainty and performance through management's choice of non-financial measures of performance (H2). To test these hypotheses, a path analytical model is applied to questionnaire survey data from 52 manufacturing companies. As hypothesized, the results revealed the existence of a significant and positive association between management's strategic choice and performance acting through management's high use of non-financial measures for performance evaluation. On the other hand, the study found no evidence of a significant relationship between environmental uncertainty and performance through management's use of non-financial performance measures. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

We predicted that control would mediate the effects of job-related uncertainty upon psychological strain, and that management communication and participation in decision-making (PDM) would reduce uncertainty and increase feelings of control. The model was tested in a public sector organization and the results supported it. Control was found to mediate the effects of job-related uncertainty upon psychological strain. Management communication was negatively related to strategic uncertainty, whereas PDM was negatively related to structural and job-related uncertainty, suggesting different mechanisms to deal with the types of uncertainty during change. Finally, PDM was positively associated with feelings of control and negatively associated with psychological strain. These results suggest that PDM can short-circuit the damaging effects of uncertainty by allowing employees to have a say in change related organizational affairs, thereby instilling a sense of control over their circumstances.","Communication; Organizational change; Uncertainty",,"Anderson, J.C., Gerbing, D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: A review and recommended two-step approach (1988) Psychological Bulletin, 103, pp. 411-423; Armenakis, A.A., Bedeian, A.G., Organizational change: A review of theory and research in the 1990s (1999) Journal of Management, 25 (1), pp. 293-315; Ashford, S.J., Individual strategies for coping with stress during organizational transitions (1988) Journal of Applied Behavioural Science, 24, pp. 19-36; Ashford, S., Black, J., Proactivity during organizational entry: The role of desire for control (1996) Journal of Applied Psychology, 81, pp. 199-214; Ashford, S.J., Lee, C., Bobko, P., Content, causes, and consequences of job insecurity: A theory-based measure and substantive test (1989) Academy of Management Journal, 32, pp. 803-829; Barnett, R.C., Brennan, R.T., The relationship between job experiences and psychological distress: A structural equation approach (1995) Journal of Organizational Behavior, 16, pp. 259-276; Bastien, D.T., Common patterns of behavior and communication in corporate mergers and acquisitions (1987) Human Resource Management, 26 (1), pp. 17-33; Bazerman, M.H., Impact of personal control on performance: Is added control always beneficial?

Surprisingly, guidelines on how to integrate different instruments in a consistent climate policy strategy are vague or lacking altogether. This can create additional and expensive market uncertainty. The optimal use of both new instruments in the European Union will also be determined by some important regulatory initiatives like the Integrated Pollution and Prevention Control (IPPC) Directive and the Green Paper on an Integrated Product Policy (IPP). The IPPC Directive will lead to the general use of Best Available Technologies in process installations while the IPP approach is based on a life cycle assessment that includes environmental impacts during the consumption phase. Both initiatives are discussed and the potential problems and inconsistencies with other instruments are indicated. An important conclusion is that VAs that look further than reducting emissions in the own industry or sector will gain importance.",,,"Albrecht, J., François, D., Negotiated environmental agreements and CO2 emissions trading (2002) Voluntary Environmental Agreements.

This peaceful transition raised expectations of a smooth process towards democratic consolidation. But similar to experiences from other African countries and Eastern Europe, the Zambian democratic process has remained stuck in a 'transitional zone' between actual democracy and authoritarian systems. We argue that Zambian elections fall short of the expectations of a democratic process due to the institutional uncertainty surrounding elections and the weakness of the Zambian Electoral Commission. Despite an alarming economic record the continued uncertainty - of the rules and regulations guiding elections and electoral administration - has maintained the same party in power through three consecutive elections.",,"election; political system; strategic approach; uncertainty role; Africa; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; Zambia","Adejumobi, S., Elections in Africa: A fading shadow of democracy?

While boom economies generate rising freight rates which are welcomed and encourage investment, ship operators may also have to face falling freight demand and declining freight rates that may have significant impact on profitability, often falling to uneconomic levels for extended periods. In such a period of uncertainty and declining profitability management will make operational decisions to reduce costs. However, shipping lines operate in a market environment so any decisions made to rationalize the trade may have significant long-term competitive implications. For example, traditional micro economic theory might suggest that the prudent strategy to adopt would be to close down the operation and reopen when the market conditions improve. In a world of certainty or when costs of taking this action are zero, this would be a valid strategy. However, because of fear of competitors taking up a line's market share if the shipping company exits, even temporarily, this strategy cannot be valued simply in terms of shut-down and start-up costs. A further consideration is the fact that standard capital budgeting techniques, such as Net Present Value (NPV), cannot incorporate the flexibility to respond to new information and strategic responses explicitly into their investment analysis. This paper will demonstrate the use of Real Option Analysis (ROA) to provide guidelines for decisions about closing operations in adverse market conditions.",,"freight transport; investment; shipping; transportation economics; Chaetodon","Bendall, H.B., Manger, G., Corporate investment decisions: What are the relevant criteria?

In this high-change and complex environment, firms face high levels of uncertainty and equivocality, and in response, they seek integrative structural mechanisms. In these organizations, product development is characterized by the use of heavyweight product development managers, concurrent engineering, and computer usage. These mechanisms give product development efforts the senior leadership to overcome resistance, the ability to integrate and coordinate activities, the access to relevant information, and the ability to process it effectively. This research describes a framework for product development practices, and it discusses relations among these variables as well as important performance variables (product innovation, quality, premium pricing, and profitability). Based on responses from 244 manufacturing firms, the study suggests that heavyweight product development managers drive the application of concurrent engineering and computer use. Computer use has a significant and positive impact on product innovation, and concurrent engineering has a positive effect on quality. Product innovation also seems to have an influence on quality. Both quality and product innovation have a significant and positive impact on premium pricing, which, in turn, influences profitability. The extent to which a firm uses a product platform strategy seems to be an important contextual variable that affects the nature of the relationships among product development practices and competitive capabilities. Firms operating in uncertain or equivocal environments appear to adopt higher levels of integrated product development practices than firms operating in low uncertainty or low equivocality environments. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The main questions individual (food) companies face are whether, why, how and with whom they should start supply chain management activities. Presents a qualitative research method for analyzing a supply chain network and for identifying effective chain redesign strategies. Presents a generic list of supply chain redesign strategies based on a multi-disciplinary literature review. Proposes that in order to identify the most effective strategies in a specific chain scenario one should focus on the identification and management of the sources of uncertainties in the supply chain's decision-making processes. The application of the research method in three food supply chains resulted in a valuable tool that can be used in supply chain redesign projects, as it indicates potentially effective redesign strategies when a specific source of uncertainty is encountered in a supply chain. © 2002, MCB UP Limited","Case studies; Food industry; Supply chain management; Uncertainty",,"Beamon, B.M., Supply chain design and analysis: models and methods (1998) International Journal of Production Economics, 55, pp. 281-294; Beamon, B.M., Ware, T.M., A process quality model for the analysis, improvement and control of supply chain systems’’ (1998) International Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management, 28, pp. 704-715; Bechtel, C., Jayaram, J., Supply chain management: a strategic perspective (1997) International Journal of Logistics Management, 8, pp. 15-33; Boehlje, M., Akridge, J., Downey, D., Restructuring agribusiness for the 21st century (1995) Agribusiness, 11, pp. 312-325; Bowersox, D.J., Closs, D.J., Hall, C.T., Beyond ERP – the storm before the calm (1998) Supply Chain Management Review, 1, pp. 28-37; Champy, J., (1995) Reengineering Management: The Mandate for New Leadership, , Harvard Business School Press, Boston, MA; Christopher, M.G., (1998) Logistics and Supply Chain Management: Strategies for Reducing Costs and Improving Services, , Pitman Publishing, London; Cooper, M.C., Lambert, D.M., Pagh, J.D., Supply chain management: more than a new name for logistics (1997) International Journal of Logistics Management, 8, pp. 1-13; Davenport, T.H., Short, J.E., The new industrial engineering: information technology and business process redesign (1990) Sloan Management Review, 31, pp. 11-27; Davis, T., Effective supply chain management (1993) Sloan Management Review, pp. 35-46. , Summer; de Leeuw, A.C.J., (2000) Bedrijfskundig Management, , Van Gorcum, Assen (in Dutch); Ellram, L.M., Supply chain management: the industrial organization perspective (1991) International Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management, 21, pp. 13-22; Ellram, L.M., Cooper, M.C., Supply chain management, partnership and the supplier-third party relationship (1990) International Journal of Logistics Management, 1, pp. 1-10; Fisher, M.L., Hammond, J., Obermeyer, W., Raman, A., Configuring a supply chain to reduve the cost of demand uncertainty (1997) Production and Operations Management, 6, pp. 211-225; Garg, A., Lee, H.L., Managing product variety: an operations perspective’ (1999) Quantitative Models for Supply Chain Management, pp. 467-490. , in Tayur, S., Ganeshan, R. and Magazine, M.

Although most CMC environments eliminate or severely reduce nonverbal and contextual information available to address uncertainty, form impressions, and develop relationships, such environments offer alternative mechanisms for acquiring social information about others. The article discusses strategies for seeking social information and identifies factors influencing their selection from alternatives, incorporating them into a conceptual model. Finally, 2 promising approaches for examining the effects and effectiveness of social information seeking in CMC are described, with an emphasis on how the proposed conceptual model can aid in the development of each.",,,"Berger, C.R., Communicating under uncertainty (1987) Interpersonal Processes, pp. 39-62. , M.

Shrimp farms in this region have been using two annual production strategies; six-to eight-month cycle with one complete harvest and several partial harvests, or two, three-to four-month cycles with complete harvests. The preferred strategy depends on two uncertain variables; shrimp growth, which varies across the region, and market price, which varies across the season. A bioeconomic model was used to compare the economic yield of the two cycling strategies for three zones across the region, under three alternative average annual temperatures states. Simple decision theory criteria are used to show that the two-cycle strategy dominates the one-cycle strategy in the Bahia de La Paz zone. Results for central and northern Sonora are conditional on temperature.

Both relatively expert and novice users are highly successful at determining classification uncertainty among pixels when shown in grey-scale images and histograms, as well as having moderate success with random animations. Viewers considered that although random animation is a good method of showing overall classification uncertainty, grey-scale images are a better way to extract specific information. Serial animation was not widely appreciated. In general, the accuracy of answers to specific questions was greatly improved when linked views and ancillary graphic information were available.

Consequently, either explicitly or implicitly, they make communicative choices, which, in turn, become the organization's communication strategy. These choices are all the more important in times of great organizational uncertainty wrought by increased global competition, quicker cycle times, and the ever-changing marketplace. What are the communication strategies available to executives? How should they be made? Which ones increase organizational effectiveness? These are the core questions discussed in this article. We conclude with a case study demonstrating the benefits of systematically developing a communication strategy to address organizational uncertainty.",,,"Byrne, J., The search for the young and gifted (1999) Business Week, pp. 108-116. , 4 October; Dean, J., Brandes, P., Dharwadkar, R., Organizational cynicism (1998) Academy of Management Review, 23, pp. 341-352; Lissack, M., Roos, J., (1999) The next Common Sense, , London: Nicholas Brealey",,,,10795545,,,,"English","Acad.

This study supports the notion that strategy is formulated in part as a response to management uncertainties about competitors, customers, and the environment. Responses from 137 wholesale grocers demonstrate that uncertainty varies by generic strategy, suggesting that businesses consider both the type and degree of uncertainty when crafting a competitive strategy. Specifically, the data suggest that viable strategic options may be limited more by the cognitive and perceptual abilities of an organization's managers than by objective measures of factors such as organizational resources and industry competitiveness. The premise that strategy must “fit” with organizational or environmental factors to be effective may be incomplete. Rather, a strategy – to be successful – should also fit with the psychological characteristics and constraints of the managers responsible for its formulation and implementation. © 2000, MCB UP Limited","Competition; Grocery industry; Management; Strategy; Uncertainty",,"Allaire, Y., Firsirotu, M.E., Coping with strategic uncertainty (1989) Sloan Management Review, Spring, pp. 7-16; Andrews, K., (1971) The Concept of Corporate Strategy, , Dow Jones, Homewood, IL; Ansoff, H.I., (1965) Corporate Strategy: An Analytical Approach to Business Policy for Growth and Expansion, , McGraw-Hill, New York, NY; Ashmore, G.M., Better information means better quality (1992) Journal of Business Strategy, 13 (3), pp. 57-60; Barney, J.B., Types of competition and the theory of strategy: toward an integrative framework (1986) Academy of Management Review, 11, pp. 91-98; Barney, J.B., Hoskisson, R.E., Strategic groups: untested assertions and research proposals (1990) Managerial and Decision Economics, 11, pp. 187-198; Bourgeois, L.J., Strategic goals, perceived uncertainty, and economic performance (1985) Academy of Management Journal, 28, pp. 548-573; Bourgeois, L.J., McAllister, D.W., Mitchell, T.R., The effects of different organizational environments upon decisions about organizational structure (1978) Academy of Management Journal, 21, pp. 508-514; Burgelman, R.A., A model of the interaction of strategic behavior, corporate context, and the concept of strategy (1983) Academy of Management Review, 7, pp. 61-70; Buzzell, R.D., Gale, B.T., (1987) The PIMS Principles, , Free Press, New York, NY; Child, J.S., Organizational structure, environment, and performance (1972) Sociology, 6, pp. 1-22; Conant, J.S., Mokwa, M.P., Varadarajan, P.R., Strategic types, distinctive marketing competencies and organizational performance: a multiple measures-based study (1990) Strategic Management Journal, 11, pp. 365-383; Covin, J.G., Entrepreneurial versus conservative firms: a comparison of strategies and performance (1991) Journal of Management Studies, 28 (5), pp. 439-462; Dacko, S.G., Sudharshan, D., Managers will find academic journals helpful (1996) Marketing News, 30 (21), p. 10; Daft, R.L., Weick, K.E., Toward a model of organizations as interpretation systems (1984) Academy of Management Review, 9 (2), pp. 284-295; Dess, G.G., Davis, P.S., Porter's generic strategies as determinants of strategic group membership and performance (1984) Academy of Management Journal, 26, pp. 467-488; Dutton, J.E., The processing of crisis and non-crisis strategic issues: a situationalist perspective (1982), working paper, New York University, NYEisenhardt, K.M., Making fast strategic decisions in high velocity environments (1989) Academy of Management Journal, 32, pp. 543-576; Fredrickson, J.W., The comprehensiveness of strategic decision processes: extension, observations, future directions (1984) Academy of Management Journal, 27, pp. 445-466; Fredrickson, J.W., Iaquinto, A.L., Inertia and creeping rationality in strategic decision processes (1989) Academy of Management Journal, 32, pp. 543-576; Fredrickson, J.W., Mitchell, T.R., Strategic decision processes: comprehensiveness and performance in an industry with an unstable environment (1984) Academy of Management Journal, 27, pp. 399-423; Golden, B.R., The past is the past – or is it?

Business environment, operations strategy and performance: an empirical study of Singapore manufacturers. Journal of Operations Management 1995;25 99-115] to the business environment of developing industries by adding two neglected environment variables: 'government laws and regulations' and 'political consideration'. We use a path analytic framework to study the effects of environment on the choice of operations strategy (low cost, quality, flexibility and delivery) and performance (self-reported change in profits) for a sample of United Arab Emirates manufacturers. We test the model suggested by Ward et al. and then test the extended model suggested for developing industries. For industries that are described as 'small business' and 'developing' rather than 'mature', we identify strong relationships between environmental factors such as labor availability, competitive hostility, government laws and regulations, political concerns and market dynamism and the operations strategy choices encompassed by competitive priorities. The data also indicates, that successful organizations (high performers), adopt competitive priorities that best fits the conditions of the environment, notably stability and dynamism. Results show that most firms accept their environment as given and install the mechanism to react to its forces. High performers match the complexity of their external environment by utilizing environmental variables as sources for effective controls within their organizations. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A number of scientific models have been used to provide policy makers involved in these preparations with sound scientific information. These include the Abatement Strategies Assessment Model (ASAM). ASAM has recently been extended to cover abatement strategies for NH3 and NOx as well as SO2, in order to address the amelioration of acidification and eutrophication in the ECE region. It is important to be able to demonstrate that the scientific information provided to policy makers is robust to uncertainties, and hence there is a need for a thorough sensitivity analysis. In this study ASAM is used to demonstrate a large degree of robustness of derived abatement strategies to uncertainties in critical loads, meteorological data and cost information. This is based on a comparison of strategies at the same overall abatement cost. Systematic changes in data are shown to influence model results more profoundly than random changes. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.","Abatement strategies assessment model; ASAM; Critical loads; Emission abatement; Integrated assessment modelling; Multi-pollutant multi-effects protocol; Transboundary air pollution; Uncertainties",,"(1990) The RAINS Model of Acidification: Science and Strategies in Europe, , J.

They provide multifunctional benefits, most prominently relating to the ecosystem, the economy and to scenic quality. Extensive areas of wetlands have been lost, either as a direct result of redesignation for other uses, especially industrial and recreational, or by qualitative degradation arising from water pollution. Although researchers have been involved in prolonged debate over wetland sustainable use management issues, the uncertain substitutability and irreversibility factors surrounding wetland functions have rarely been addressed. In considering policies for wetland resource management, decision rules and procedures must be adapted to reflect those uncertainties. In this study, the author incorporates the concept of the 'safe minimum standard of conservation' approach to take account of natural and social uncertainties attending public decisions. By this approach, not only is the role of uncertain substitutability and irreversibility prioritized in addressing wetland sustainable use management strategies, but related policy implications may also be considered.",,"environmental management; habitat use; strategic approach; wetland","Bishop, R.C., Endangered Species and Uncertainty: The Economics of a Safe Minimum Standard (1978) American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 60, pp. 10-18; Boadway, R.W., Wildasin, D.E., (1984) Public Sector Economics (Ed.), , Boston: Little, Brown and Company; Chavas, J.P., On Sustainability and the Economics of Survival (1993) American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 75, pp. 72-83; Ciriacy-Wantrup, S.V., (1952) Resource Conservation: Economics and Policies, , Berkeley: University of California Press; Conrad, J.M., Quasi-Option Value and the Expected Value of Information (1980) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 94, pp. 813-820; Daly, H.E., (1991) Steady-State Economics: Second Edition with New Essays, , Washington, D.C: Island Press; Ekins, P., (1992) The Gaia Atlas of Green Economics, , New York: Anchor Books; Fisher, A.C., Hanemann, W.M., Quasi-Option Value: Some Misconceptions Dispelled (1987) Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 14, pp. 183-190; Freeman, A.M., (1993) The Measurement of Environmental and Resource Values: Theory and Methods, , Washington, D.C.: Resources for the Future; Henry, C., Investment Decisions under Uncertainty: The 'Irreversibility Effect.'

The firm faces uncertain product demand and has the option to dynamically readjust its resource investment levels, thereby changing the capacities of its linear manufacturing process. The cost to adjust a resource level either up or down is assumed to be linear. The model developed here explicitly incorporates both capacity investment decisions and production decisions, and is general enough to include reversible and irreversible investment. The product demand vectors for successive periods are assumed to be independent and identically distributed. The optimal investment strategy is determined with a multi-dimensional newsvendor model using demand distributions, a technology matrix, prices (product contribution margins), and marginal investment costs. Our analysis highlights an important conceptual distinction between deterministic and stochastic environments: the optimal investment strategy in our stochastic model typically involves some degree of capacity imbalance which can never be optimal when demand is known.","Capacity investment; Multi-dimensional newsvendor model; Operational hedging; Prices; Strategic planning","Decision making; Mathematical models; Optimization; Probability; Product development; Random processes; Resource allocation; Risk management; Strategic planning; Vectors; Capacity imbalance; Demand uncertainty; Multi-dimensional newsvendor model; Multi-resource investment strategies; Operational hedging; Product demand vectors; Marketing","Manne, A.S., Capacity expansion and probabilistic growth (1961) Econometrica, 29 (4), pp. 632-649; Luss, H., Operations research and capacity expansion problems: A survey (1982) Operations Research, 30, pp. 907-947; Davis, M.H.A., Dempster, M.A.H., Sethi, S.P., Vermes, D., Optimal capacity expansion under uncertainty (1987) Advances in Applied Probability, 19, pp. 156-176; Bean, J.C., Higle, J.L., Smith, R.L., Capacity expansion under stochastic demands (1992) Operations Research, 40 (SUPPL. 2), pp. 210-S216; Eppen, G.D., Martin, R.K., Schrage, L., A scenario approach to capacity planning (1989) Operations Research, 37 (4), pp. 517-527; Fine, C.H., Freund, R.M., Optimal investment in product-flexible manufacturing capacity (1990) Management Science, 36 (4), pp. 449-466; Li, S., Tirupati, D., Dynamic capacity expansion problem with multiple products: Technology selection and timing of capacity additions (1994) Operations Research, 42 (5), pp. 958-976; Dixit, A., Investment and employment dynamics in the short run and the long run (1997) Oxford Economic Papers, 49, pp. 1-20; Eberly, J.C., Van Mieghem, J.A., Multi-factor dynamic investment under uncertainty (1997) Journal of Economic Theory, 75 (2), pp. 345-387; Van Mieghem, J.A., Investment strategies for flexible resources Management Science, , forthcoming; Van Mieghem, J.A., (1998) Capacity Investment under Demand Uncertainty: The Option Value of Subcontracting, , Technical report 1208, Center for Mathematical Studies in Economics and Management Sciences, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL; Dixit, A.K., Pindyck, R.S., (1994) Investment under Uncertainty, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Bakke, N.A., Hellberg, R., The challenges of capacity planning (1993) International Journal of Production Economics, 30 (31), pp. 243-264; Veral, E.A., Laforge, R.L., The integration of cost and capacity considerations in material requirements planning systems (1990) Decision Sciences, 21 (3), pp. 507-520; Cowie, A.P., (1989) Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary of Current English, 4th Ed., , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Huchzermeier, A., Cohen, M.A., Valuing operational flexibility under exchange rate risk (1996) Operations Research, 44 (1), pp. 100-113; Wets, R.J.-B., Programming under uncertainty: The equivalent convex program (1966) J.

Drawing from transaction cost economics, they predicted that increases in environmental uncertainty would reduce a company's ability to manage its subsidiaries efficiently and would lead to divestiture. Conversely, they predicted that decreases in environmental uncertainty would enable a company to manage its subsidiaries more efficiently and would lead to acquisition. Those predictions were expected to be strongest for firms with intermediate levels of diversification, as such firms are believed to be the most difficult to manage efficiently. Repeated measures analyses of a panel of 164 Fortune 500 companies supported the predictions for highly diversified firms (e.g., unrelated businesses) only. Less diversified firms reacted to increases in uncertainty by acquiring and to decreases in uncertainty by divesting. The results suggest that the relationship between diversification strategy and portfolio restructuring depends on environmental uncertainty. In addition, the study findings imply that there may be limits in the hierarchy's governance efficiency in relation to market modes and that those limits may be affected by environmental uncertainty and diversification strategy.","Acquisition and Divestiture; Firm Scope; Portfolio Restructuring",,"Aldrich, H.E., (1979) Organizations and Environments, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall; Alexander, J.A., Adaptive Change in Corporate Control Practices (1991) Academy of Management Journal, 34, pp. 162-193; Baysinger, B., Hoskisson, R.E., Diversification Strategy and R&D Intensity in Multiproduct Firms (1989) Academy of Management Journal, 32, pp. 310-332; Bergh, D.D., (1991) An Organizational Economic Model of Corporate Restructuring, , Unpublished doctoral dissertation, University of Colorado; Size and Relatedness of Units Sold: An Agency Theory and Resource-Based Perspective (1995) Strategic Management Journal, 16, pp. 221-239; Problems with Repeated Measures Analysis: Demonstration with a Study of the the Diversification and Divestiture Relationship (1995) Academy of Management Journal, 38, pp. 1692-1708; Product-Market Uncertainty, Portfolio Restructuring, and Performance: An Information-Processing and Resource-Based View (1998) Journal of Management, , Forthcoming; Bethel, J.E., Liebeskind, J., The Effects of Ownership Structure on Corporate Restructuring (1993) Strategic Management Journal, 14 (SPEC.

But what happens when the environment is so uncertain that no amount of analysis will allow us to predict the future? What makes for a good strategy in highly uncertain business environments? The authors, consultants at McKinsey & Company, argue that uncertainty requires a new way of thinking about strategy. All too often, they say, executives take a binary view: either they underestimate uncertainty to come up with the forecasts required by their companies' planning or capital-budging processes, or they overestimate it, abandon all analysis, and go with their gut instinct. The authors outline a new approach that begins by making a crucial distinction among four discrete levels of uncertainty that any company might face. They then explain how a set of generic strategies--shaping the market, adapting to it, or reserving the right to play at a later time--can be used in each of the four levels. And they illustrate how these strategies can be implemented through a combination of three basic types of actions: big bets, options, and no-regrets moves. The framework can help managers determine which analytic tools can inform decision making under uncertainty--and which cannot. At a broader level, it offers executives a discipline for thinking rigorously and systematically about uncertainty and its implications for strategy.",,"article; classification; commercial phenomena; economic aspect; economics; forecasting; health care cost; investment; leadership; organization; organization and management; system analysis; United States; Capital Expenditures; Commerce; Economic Competition; Forecasting; Investments; Leadership; Organizational Innovation; Planning Techniques; Systems Analysis; United States",,"Courtney, H.",,,00178012,,,10174798,"English","Harv Bus Rev",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031265425

Conceptually, the paper argues that this variability is an implication of uncertainty which has been neglected in the literature. In particular, in response to uncertainty, firms develop different types of flexibility with respect to production, technology, and employment in sometimes novel ways that do not correspond to ideal types. Empirically, the argument is demonstrated through a detailed examination of several case study firms operating in the wood remanufacturing industry of the Vancouver metropolitan area, British Columbia.","Enterprise strategy; Flexible specialization; Uncertainty; Vancouver; Wood remanufacturing","flexible specialization; industry","Atkinson, J., Manpower strategies for flexibleorganisations (1984) Personnel Management, AUGUST, pp. 28-31; Flexibility or fragmentation?

The experimental conditions included three demand patterns, three planning horizons, and two capacity levels. Each method’s performance was compared to an expected value with perfect information (EVwPI), which was determined with the assistance of an integrated modelling approach. The six methods were also statistically compared with each other. The results showed relatively small differences (3.5%) between the more effective methods and the EVwPI.

Bidirectional relaying applies to three-node networks, where a relay establishes a bidirectional communication between two other nodes using a decode-and-forward protocol. First, the two nodes transmit their messages to the relay which decodes them. Then, the relay broadcasts a re-encoded message in such a way that both nodes can decode their intended message using their own message as side information. We consider uncertainty in the channel state information (CSI) and assume that all nodes only know that the channel over which the transmission takes place is from a pre-specified set of channels. In this work, we concentrate on the second phase, which is called the compound bidirectional broadcast channel. We present a robust coding strategy which enables reliable communication under channel uncertainty and show that this strategy actually achieves the compound capacity. Further, we analyze scenarios where either the receivers or the transmitter have perfect CSI. We show that CSI at the receivers does not affect the maximal achievable rates, while CSI at the transmitter improves the capacity region. A numerical example and a game-theoretic interpretation complete this work. © 1993 IEEE.","channel uncertainty; information rates; Relay; robustness; wireless networks",,"Rankov, B., Wittneben, A., Spectral efficient protocols for half-duplex duplex fading relay channels (2007) IEEE J.

We developed a measure of the innovation management process, specifically organizational norms toward innovation, and examined its relationship to innovation (as measured by effective entrepreneurial strategy) in combination with measures of organizational structure and environment. Survey responses from respondents within 77 strategic business units were analyzed. Innovation norms, degree of decentralization in organizational structure, and environmental uncertainty explained significant and meaningful variance in entrepreneurial strategy. Interestingly, correlations between success of entrepreneurial strategy and (a) organizational structure and (b) environmental uncertainty approach zero when innovation-related norms are partialled out. Implications are discussed for the integration of this previously unexamined process variable innovation norms-to extend theories of innovation and corporate entrepreneurship. © 1992, Sage Publications.

Four case study water resources development projects demonstrate both why TARDA conducts assessments and how it manages the threats EIA poses to its autonomy. In two cases, TARDA initiated EIAs on its own, and the assessment process legitimated TARDA's activities and previously held positions. In two other cases, EIAs were conducted at the insistence of foreign donors as a condition for project support. These two cases demonstrate TARDA's use of compromise, secrecy, and resource substitution as strategies to minimize the influence of EIA on its decisions. All four case studies show the inability of Kenya's National Environment Secretariat to have TARDA comply with national EIA requirements promoted by the Secretariat. © 1991.",,"decision-making process; developing country; environmental impact; environmental impact assessment; impact assessment; resources development; river development; river development authority; Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority; water planning; water resources development; Kenya","Agrar and Hydrotechnik and Watermeyer Legge Piesold and Uhlman, Pre-Investment Study of the Athi River Basin (1980) Report prepared for the Tana River Development Authority, , Nairobi, Kenya. 3 volumes; Benveniste, (1981) Regulation and Planning: The Case of Environmental Politics, , Boyd & Fraser, San Francisco, CA; Ecosystems, Ltd., (1985) Tana Delta Ecological Impact Study: Final Report, , Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority, Nairobi, Kenya, Prepared for the; Engineering and Power Development Consultants Ltd., (1980) Kiambere Hydroelectric Development.

It is argued that the strategy that will produce the best results is dependent on existing environmental circumstances (Miles & Snow, 1978). This study investigated the tenet that, for firms in the lodging industry, there exists an optimal pattern or ''fit'' between the environment and the firm's business strategy that separates the more successful operations from the less successful ones. The findings of this study indicate that a “match” between the state of the environment facing an organization and its business strategy is required for high performance.

In MRP, there is a critical need to make the MPS predictable and consistent. In the early days of MRP, a philosophy of zero safety stock or safety time was rigorously advocated. It was thought to be more advantageous to eliminate the need for buffering by freezing the MPS and managing lead times to make these firm. However, it was soon recognized that it is extremely difficult, in practice, to eliminate all uncertainty that affects the MPS and its execution. Practitioners know that some level of buffering is necessary (or inevitable) given the vicissitudes of the market place, production system planning and control, and supplier performance. This article accepts these premises and proposes a model and procedures for dealing with the buffering problem and choosing optimal buffering strategies in MRP. © 1987.",,,,,,,02726963,,JOTME,,"English","J Oper Manage",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-38249033670

However, there exists no formal theory of manufacturing strategy to explain the phenomenon. There is a real need for empirical studies for the development of such a theory. The empirical section of this study based on data gathered from 35 manufacturers found that environmental uncertainty influenced manufacturing strategy variables such as Manufacturing Flexibility, and the Role of Manufacturing Managers in Strategic Decision Making.

Environmental uncertainty and synergy considerations are considered to be the fundamental determinants in strategy formulation, the firm's strategy reflecting a choice between potential synergistic gains and increased vulnerability to environmental threats. A formal model of corporate strategy is developed explaining strategic behaviour as a function of opportunities for synergistic gains and level of environmental uncertainty. The empirical relevance of the model is demonstrated by utilizing data from four major studies of corporate strategy in the USA, the UK, France and West Germany.

Differences likely result because of individuals' cognitive schemes, which include their cognitive biases. In turn, systematic errors may occur in managerial decisions. Results from the research reported herein support the notion that managers' perceptions of the indicators of a firm's strengths and weaknesses, and of environmental uncertainty, vary by managerial level. Differences in these perceptions were discovered to be more significant within each firm. Implications of these results are examined, including the impact on the deployment of firms' strategy formulation processes.

What is overlooked by such arguments is that the existence of such uncertainties can, under certain circumstances, encourage rather than deter attack. Uncertainty might be useful to the extent that it concerns enemy perceptions of areas in which the United States is weak. However, the best way to deter war and increase American bargaining ability vis‐a‐vis the Soviet Union is not to increase uncertainty but to reduce, as far as possible, the Soviet leadership’s estimate of its chances in a war with the United States. © 1985 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,"Nitze, P., Deterring our Deterrent (1976) Foreign Policy, , Winter; Gray, C.S., Nuclear Strategy: The Case for a Theoryof Victory (1979) International Security, pp. 54-87. , Summer; Jervis, R., Why Nuclear Superiority Doesn’t Matter (1979) Political Science Quarterly, 94, pp. 617-633; Howard, M., On Fightirtg a Nuclear War (1981) International Security; Kincade, W., Will MX Backfire (1979) Foreign Policy, , Summer; Brown, H., (1978) Department of Defense Annual Report, p. 63. , Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office; Feld, B., Tsipis, K., Land-Based Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (1979) Scientific American, 5, pp. 51-61; Snow, D., (1983) The Nuclear Future, , University, AL: University of Alabama Press; Lambeth, B., (1981) Risk and Uncertainty in Soviet Calculations about War and Peace, , Santa Monica: RAND Corporation; Bennett, B., (1979) Uncertainty in ICBM Survivability, , Santa Monica: RAND Corporation; Colin, S., (1981) Gray, , Boulder: Westview Press; Snow, S., The MX ICBM and National Security, p. 159; Gray, G., The MX ICBM and National Security, pp. 31-32; Hays, W.L., Winkler, R.L., (1971) Statistics, , New York: Holt, Rinehart & Winston; Schlaifer, R., (1969) Analysis of Decisions under Uncertainty, , New York: McGraw-Hill; Savage, L.J., (1972) The Foundations of Statistics, , 2nd revised edition New York: Dover Publications; Altfeld, M.F., Mesquita, B.B.D., Choosing Sides in Wars (1979) International Studies Quarterly; Mesquita, B.B.D., Risk, Power Distributions and the Likelihood of War (1981) International Studies Quarterly, , December; Mesquita, B.B.D., Riker, W.H., An Assessment of the Effects of Selective Nuclear Proliferation (1982) Journal of Conflict Resolution; Morrow, J.D., (1983) A Continuous-Outcome Expected Utility Theory of War, , prepared for presentation at the 19th North American Peace Science Conference, Urbana, IL, November; Wohlstetter, R., (1963) Pearl Harbor: Warning and Decision, p. 350. , Stanford: Stanford University Press; Holsti, O.R., (1972) Crisis Escalation War, , Montreal: McGill-Queen’s University Press; Schelling, T.C., The Strategy of Conflict, p. 8. , Cambridge: Harvard University Presschapter; Snow, S., The Strategy of Conflict, p. 144; Snow, S., The Strategy of Conflict, p. 143; Snow, S., The Strategy of Conflict, p. 155; Tsipis, F., The Strategy of Conflict, p. 56; Kincade, K., The Strategy of Conflict, p. 49; Snow, S., The Strategy of Conflict, p. 161; Snow, S., The Strategy of Conflict, p. 159; Schell, J., (1982) The Fate of the Earth, , Avon Books: New York; (1975) Effects of Multiple Nuclear Explosions Worldwide, , Washington, D.C.: National Academy of Sciences; Congress, U.S., Office of Technology Assessment (1979) The Effects of Nuclear War, , Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office; Gray, C.S., (1982) Dangerous to Your Health, , Orbis, Summer; Gray, C.S., Dangerous to Your Health, , passim; Snow, S., Dangerous to Your Health, p. 161; Kincade, K., Dangerous to Your Health, p. 49; Wiesner, J., Russian and American Capabilities (1982) The Atlantic Monthly, 51, p. 52. , July; Pipes, R., Why the Soviet Union Thinks it Could Fight and Win a Nuclear War (1977) Commentary, , July; Gray, G., Nuclear Strategy Why the Soviet Union Thinks It Could Fight and Win a Nuclear War; Snow, S., Why the Soviet Union Thinks It Could Fight and Win a Nuclear War, p. 161; Blainey, G., (1973) The Causes of War, , New York: The Free Press; Douglass, J.D., Hoeber, A.M., (1979) Soviet Strategy for Nuclear War, , Stanford: Hoover Institution Press; Snow, S., Soviet Strategy for Nuclear War, p. 164; Gray, G., The MX ICBM and National Security, p. 88; Snow, S., The MX ICBM and National Security, p. 166; Scoville, H., (1981) MX: Prescription for Disaster, p. 36. , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Godson, R., (1980) Intelligence Requirements for the 1980’s: Counterintelligence, , Washington, D.C.: National Strategy Information Center; Davis, J.K., (1979) The Soviet Union and Ballistic Missile Defense, p. 26. , Cambridge, MA: Institute for Foreign Policy Analysis","Altfeld, M.F.; Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, United States",,,01495933,,,,"English","Comp.

Data gathered during a participant-observation study of an organization serving developmentally disabled adults led to the identification of 11 such strategies. The strategies fall into two basic classes: defensive strategies in which the participant attempts to manage the conversation by saying as little as possible of substance, and offensive strategies in which the uncertain participant tries to push the conversation toward safer and more certain grounds. © 1983, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

However, measures of uncertainty that would be appropriate for general use in measuring product-attribute associated uncertainty have not been developed and assessed. In this paper, two methodologies that may be appropriate are presented and evaluated. Comparison of the methods shows both approaches to be about equal when evaluated with respect to convergent and face validity, test-retest reliability, and the ability of each measure to predict preference. Possible uses of product-attribute uncertainty measures in assisting managers to formulate communications strategy are discussed. © 1983.",,,"Berlyne, (1960) Conflict, Arousal, and Curiosity, , McGraw-Hill, New York; Bettman, (1979) An Information Processing Theory of Consumer Choice, , Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA; Bettman, Perceived Risk and its Components A Model and Empirical Test (1973) Journal of Marketing Research, 10, pp. 184-190; Campbell, Fiske, Convergent and Discriminant Validation by the Multitrait-Multimethod Matrix (1959) Psychol.

The results have been interpreted in terms of models of pattern recognition. In this paper target uncertainty was studied in tasks where subjects could exert greater freedom in determining their scanning strategies. With eye movement recording, it was established that skewed distributions of search times are obtained even when subjects adopt comparatively systematic strategies. There was no evidence that processing time, as reflected in eye fixation times, was generally lengthened with increase in target uncertainty. The observed effects of target uncertainty were discussed in relation to how subjects attempt to overcome the problem of searching simultaneously for targets of different conspicuity. © 1979, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

Instructions, experimental conditions, and the number of different patterns to be sorted into two trays were varied in an attempt to change Ss' strategies from whole-pattern processing to single-element processing. Instructions alone were ineffectual in preventing whole-pattern processing, and physical masks over most of the criterion stimuli (patterns used as guides in sorting) were only somewhat effective. Differences among tasks that were attributable to size of equivalence set were eliminated only by arranging the stimuli so that a whole-pattern strategy required a great deal more information processing, or so that such a strategy could not lead to the required discrimination. The results were interpreted as confirming the influence of the properties of sets of stimuli, as well as the strength of the tendency of human Ss to process and categorize patterns in their entirety. nt]mis|This research was supported in part by a University Research Council grant. © 1970 Psychonomic Society, Inc.",,,"Brown, D.R., Goldstein, J.A., Stimulus correlates of discrimination behavior of children (1967) Psychonomic Science, 9, pp. 177-178; Clement, D.E., Uncertainty and latency of verbal naming responses as correlates of pattern goodness (1964) Journal of Verbal Learning & Verbal Behavior, 3, pp. 150-157; Clement, D.E., Paired-associate learning as a correlate of pattern goodness (1967) Journal of Verbal Learning & Verbal Behavior, 6, pp. 112-116; Clement, D.E., Varnadoe, K.W., Pattern uncertainty and the discrimination of visual patterns (1967) Perception & Psychophysics, 2, pp. 427-431; Edmonds, E.M., Mueller, M.R., Evans, S.H., Effects of knowledge of results on mixed schema discrimination (1966) Psychonomic Science, 6, pp. 377-378; Egeth, H., Selective attention (1967) Psychological Bulletin, 67, pp. 41-57; Evans, S.H., A brief statement of schema theory (1967) Psychonomic Science, 8, pp. 87-88; Garner, W.R., (1962) Uncertainty and structure as psychological concepts, , Wiley, New York; Garner, W.R., To perceive is to know (1966) American Psychologist, 21, pp. 11-19; Garner, W.R., Clement, D.E., Goodness of pattern and pattern uncertainty (1963) Journal of Verbal Learning & Verbal Behavior, 2, pp. 446-452; Handel, S., Garner, W.R., The structure of visual pattern associates and pattern goodness (1966) Perception & Psychophysics, 1, pp. 33-38; Polidora, V.J., Stimulus correlates of visual pattern discrimination by monkeys: Multidimensional analyses (1966) Perception & Psychophysics, 1, pp. 405-414; Royer, F.L., Figurai goodness and internal structure in perceptual discrimination (1966) Perception & Psychophysics, 1, pp. 311-314; Sexton, E., McLaughlin, J.P., Set and the encoding of visual stimuli (1967) Psychonomic Science, 9, pp. 219-220; Shepard, R.N., Learning and recall as organization and search (1966) Journal of Verbal Learning & Verbal Behavior, 5, pp. 201-204; Sternberg, S., Two operations in character recognition: Some evidence from reaction-time measurements (1967) Perception & Psychophysics, 2, pp. 45-53; Thurmond, J.B., Alluisi, E.A., An extension of the information-deductive analysis of form (1967) Psychonomic Science, 7, pp. 157-158","Clement, D.E.; Department of Psychology, University of South Florida, Tampa, 33620, Florida, United States",,,00315117,,PEPSB,,"English","Percept.
