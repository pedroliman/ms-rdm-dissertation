We asked 27 expert entrepreneurs and 37 MBA students to think aloud continuously as they solved typical decision-making problems in creating a new venture. Transcriptions were analyzed using methods from cognitive science. Results showed that expert entrepreneurs framed problems in a dramatically different way than MBA students.","Decision-making; Effectuation; Entrepreneur; Expertise; Framing",,"Amit, R., Glosten, L., Muller, E., Entrepreneurial ability, venture investments, and risk sharing (1990) Management Science, 36 (10), pp. 1232-1245; Anderson, J.R., (1981) Cognitive Skills and Their Acquisition, , Lawrence Erlbaum Associates; Andersson, P., Does experience matter in lending?

To address this gap, our paper uses an inductive, theory-building methodology to develop propositions regarding how effectuation processes are impacted when entrepreneurs adopt Twitter. Twitter is a microblogging platform that can facilitate a marked increase in interaction. We posit that Twitter-based interaction can trigger effectual cognitions, but that high levels of interaction via this medium can lead to effectual churn. We also posit that there is one factor, perceived time affordability, that predicts the level of social interaction in which an entrepreneur engages via Twitter. Further, we propose two factors that moderate the consequences of social interaction through Twitter. These factors are community orientation and community norm adherence. Implications for our understanding of effectuation, of social interaction, and of the impact of social media on entrepreneurial firms are discussed. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Effectuation; Social media; Twitter",,"Ashforth, B., Kreiner, G., Clark, M., Fugate, M., Normalizing dirty work: occupational tactics for countering occupational taint (2007) Academy of Management Journal, 50 (1), pp. 149-174; Bamberger, P., Beyond contextualization: using context theories to narrow the micro-macro gap in management research (2008) Academy of Management Journal, 51 (5), pp. 839-846; Barnes, N.G., Mattson, E., (2009) Social Media in the 2009 Inc. 500: New Tools and New Trends, , http://www.umassd.edu/cmr/studiesresearch/socialmedia2009.cfm, University of MA Dartmouth Center for Marketing Research; Baron, R.A., Markman, G., Beyond social capital: the role of entrepreneurs' social competence in their financial success (2003) Journal of Business Venturing, 18 (1), pp. 41-60; Baron, R.A., Tang, J., Entrepreneurs' social skills and new venture performance: mediating mechanisms and cultural generality (2009) Journal of Management, 35 (2), pp. 282-306; Berinato, S., Six ways to find value in Twitter's noise (2010) Harvard Business Review, 88 (6), pp. 34-35; The state of small business report December 2009, , http://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/ces/pdfs_docs/SBSI_February_2010.pdf, Center for Excellence in Service; Cheng, A., Evans, M., (2009) An In-depth Look at the 5% of Most Active Users, , http://www.sysomos.com/insidetwitter/mostactiveusers, Sysomos Research Library, August; Chiles, T., Gupta, V., Bluedorn, A., On Lachmannian and effectual entrepreneurship: a rejoinder to Sarasvathy and Dew (2008) (2008) Organization Studies, 29 (2), pp. 247-253; Comm, J., (2009) Twitter Power: How to Dominate Your Market One Tweet at a Time, , John Wiley & Sons, Hoboken NJ; Corkery, M., Vascellaro, J.E., Breaking news: Twitter to raise $100million from Insight, T.

The authors use protocol analysis to evaluate how 27 expert entrepreneurs approach such a problem compared with 37 managers with little entrepreneurial expertise (all 64 participants are asked to think aloud as they make marketing decisions in exactly the same unpredictable situation). The hypotheses are drawn from literature in cognitive science on (1) expertise in general and (2) entrepreneurial expertise in particular. The results show significant differences in heuristics used by the two groups. While those without entrepreneurial expertise rely primarily on predictive techniques, expert entrepreneurs tend to invert these. In particular, they use an effectual or nonpredictive logic to tackle uncertain market elements and to coconstruct novel markets with committed stakeholders. © 2009, American Marketing Association.","Cocreation; Effectuation; Expertise; Service-dominant logic; Uncertainty",,"Achrol, R., Evolution of the Marketing Organization: New Forms for Turbulent Environments (1991) Journal of Marketing, 55, pp. 77-93. , October; Achrol, R., Kotler, P., Marketing in the Network Economy (1999) Journal of Marketing, 63 (SPEC.

Our measure of causation is a well-defined and coherent uni-dimensional construct. We propose that effectuation is a formative, multidimensional construct with three associated sub-dimensions (experimentation, affordable loss, and flexibility) and one dimension shared with the causation construct (pre-commitments). As specified by Sarasvathy (2001), we also show that causation is negatively associated with uncertainty, while experimentation, a sub-dimension of effectuation, is positively correlated with uncertainty. The major contribution is the resulting validated scales that measure causation and effectuation. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.","Causation; Effectuation; Measurement validation",,"Akerlof, G.A., Yellen, J.L., Unemployment through the filter of memory (1985) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 100, pp. 747-773; Allen, K., (2003) Launching New Ventures: An Entrepreneurial Approach, , Houghton Mifflin, Boston, MA; Ansoff, H.I., (1988) The New Corporate Strategy, , Wiley, New York; Arnold, T.J., Landry, T.D., Reynolds, J.K., Retail online assurances: typology development and empirical analysis (2007) Journal of Marketing Theory and Practice, 15 (4), pp. 299-313; Arrindell, W.A., van der Ende, J., An empirical test of the utility of the observations-to-variables ratio in factor and components analysis (1985) Applied Psychological Measurement, 9, pp. 165-178; Bagozzi, R.P., Yi, Y., Phillips, L.W., Assessing construct validity in organizational research (1991) Administrative Science Quarterly, 36 (3), pp. 421-458; Bartlett, M.S., Tests of significance in factor analysis (1950) British Journal of Psychology, Statistical Section, 3, pp. 77-85; Bentler, P.M., On the fit of models to covariances and methodology to the Bulletin (1992) Psychological Bulletin, 112, pp. 400-404; Bollen, K., Lennox, R., Conventional wisdom on measurement: a structural equation perspective (1991) Psychological Bulletin, 110 (2), pp. 305-314; Brews, P.J., Hunt, M.R., Learning to plan and planning to learn: resolving the planning school/learning school debate (1999) Strategic Management Journal, 20 (10), pp. 889-913; Brown, S.L., Eisenhardt, K.M., The art of continuous change: linking complexity theory and time-paced evolution in relentlessly shifting organizations (1997) Administrative Science Quarterly, 42 (1), pp. 1-34; Browne, M.W., Cudeck, R., Alternative ways of assessing model fit (1993) Testing Structural Equation Models, pp. 136-162. , Sage, Newbury Park, K.A.

This paper shows that the first of these approaches-which focuses on how alert entrepreneurs discover objective opportunities formed by exogenous shocks in an existing market-adopts a critical realist perspective. The second approach-which focuses on opportunities that are endogenously enacted by the actions of entrepreneurs themselves and do not have an existence independent of those human actions-adopts an evolutionary realist perspective. Differences between these epistemological assumptions have an important impact on opportunity research in the field of entrepreneurship, and thus are likely to have an important impact on the evolution of research, practice, and teaching in the field of entrepreneurship as a whole. © 2010 Academy of Management.",,,"Ackroyd, S., Fleetwood, S., (2000) Realist perspective on management and organizations, , London: Routledge; Aldrich, H.E., Kenworthy, A.L., The accidental entrepreneur: Campbellian antinomies and organizational foundings (1999) Variations in organization science: In honor of Donald T.

In this study of 121 angel investors who had made 1038 new venture investments, we empirically investigate angel investors' differential use of predictive versus non-predictive control strategies. We show how the use of these strategies affects the outcomes of angel investors. Results show that angels who emphasize prediction make significantly larger venture investments, while those who emphasize non-predictive control experience a reduction in investment failures without a reduction in their number of successes. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The graphical treatment of the variables demonstrates the internationalization mechanism's consistency with the risk formula. In particular, commitment manipulation develops a risk management perspective to the model, wherein contingent uncertainty is a central concept. The main contribution consists in the composition of a set of hypotheses on the effects of risk contingencies on a firm's commitment behavior in different internationalization phases. A pertinent remark that emerges from this analytical exercise is the Uppsala model's contingent nature, which explains the differences in the pattern and pace of the internationalization process, as well as potential leapfrogging and market-exit moves. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Commitment; Contingency; Contingent uncertainty; Internationalization; Internationalization process; Knowledge; Risk; Risk management; Uncertainty; Uppsala model",,"Aharoni, Y., (1966) The foreign investment decision process, , Harvard Business School, Boston, MA; Andersen, O., On the internationalization process of firms: A critical analysis (1993) Journal of International Business Studies, 24 (2), pp. 209-231; Anderson, E., Gatignon, H., Modes of foreign entry: A transaction cost analysis and propositions (1986) Journal of International Business Studies, 17, pp. 1-26; Atkins, M., Anderson, A., Risk, uncertainty and the entrepreneurial vision (1999) Risk Management (Bas), 1, pp. 35-48; Barbalet, J.M., The Jamesian theory of action (1997) Sociological Review, 45, pp. 102-121; Benito, G.R.G., Welch, L.S., De-internationalization (1997) Management International Review, 37 (2), pp. 7-25; Bion, W., (1962) Learning from experience, , Heinemann, London; Blomstermo, A., Eriksson, K., Lindstrand, A., Sharma, D.D., The perceived usefulness of network experiential knowledge in internationalizing firm (2004) Journal of International Management, 10, pp. 355-373; Blomstermo, A., Eriksson, K., Sharma, D.D., Domestic activity and knowledge development in the internationalization process of firms (2004) Journal of International Entrepreneurship, 2 (3), pp. 239-258; Boersma, M.F., Buckley, P.J., Ghauri, P.N., Trust in joint venture relationships (2003) Journal of Business Research, 56 (12), pp. 1031-1042; Bresman, H., Birkinshaw, J., Nobel, R., Knowledge transfer in international acquisitions (1999) Journal of International Business Studies, 30 (3), pp. 439-462; Buckley, P., Casson, M., Analyzing foreign market entry strategies: Extending the internalization approach (1998) Journal of International Business Studies, 29, pp. 539-562; (1967) Risk taking and information handling in consumer behavior, , Harvard University, Boston, MA, D.F.

We argue that dynamic capability is a phenomenon that enables a deviation to take place from the knowledge that otherwise would have arisen cumulatively from experiential learning. In addition we argue that to create major changes in patterns of knowledge accumulation managers need to be purposefully and creatively engaged. Such agency is identifiable in two cognitive processes we call creative search and strategic sense-making. We show how these processes differ in respect to their temporal orientation and relationship to uncertainty and by adopting a process perspective we demonstrate how creative search, strategic sense-making and experiential learning are complementary. This notion of complementarity implies that these processes, notwithstanding their contrasting characteristics, coexist together and serve to offer an explanation for how knowledge progresses at a firm level. Variance is introduced into the framework proposed through the identification of factors that influence the coexistence of creative search and strategic sense-making. The argument developed is illustrated through the use of an emergent technology context. © 2009 British Academy of Management.",,,"Adner, R., Helfat, C.E., Corporate effects and dynamic managerial capabilities (2003) Strategic Management Journal, 24, pp. 1011-1025. , pp; Bettis, R.A., Prahalad, C.K., The dominant logic: Retrospective and extension (1995) Strategic Management Journal, 16, pp. 5-17. , pp; Bogner, W.C., Barr, P.S., Making sense in hypercompetitive environments: A cognitive explanation for the persistence of high velocity competition (2000) Organization Science, 11, pp. 212-216. , pp; Brown, S.L., Eisenhardt, K.M., The art of continuous change: Linking complexity theory and time-paced evolution in relentlessly shifting organizations (1997) Administrative Science Quarterly, 42, pp. 1-34. , pp; Burgelman, R.A., A process model of strategic business exit: Implication for an evolutionary perspective on strategy (1996) Strategic Management Journal, 17, pp. 193-214. , pp; Burke, W.W., (2002) Organization Change: Theory and Practice., , London.

However, many companies have difficulties finding efficient and successful approaches to different types of R&D projects, particularly those that involve a high level of innovativeness. Therefore, the present study moves effectuation theory from the entrepreneurial context to R&D research. First, the characteristics of an effectual approach in the context of R&D projects are developed and differentiated from those of conventional prediction-based strategies (causation). Second, using a thorough qualitative and quantitative scale-development process to capture particularities of effectual and causal dimensions in the R&D context, expert interviews and a pilot study (123 R&D projects), the study develops a multi-factor measurement model of effectuation and causation. These measures are validated in a follow-up study with a larger sample of 400 projects. Third, the new measures are applied to test two central hypotheses: (a) effectuation is positively related to success in highly innovative contexts, (b) causation approaches are beneficial in projects with low levels of innovativeness. Overall, this study moves the effectuation logic from the entrepreneurial to the corporate R&D context, captures its particularities, and investigates its performance outcomes. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Causation; Effectuation; Project performance; R&D projects; Scale development; Structural equation modeling",,"Arminger, G., Muthén, B., A Bayesian approach to nonlinear latent variable models using the Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (1997) Psychometrika, 63 (3), pp. 271-300; Astley, W.G., Zajac, E.J., Intraorganizational power and organizational design: reconciling rational and coalitional models of organization (1991) Organization Science, 2 (4), pp. 399-411; Atuahene-Gima, K., Resolving the capability-rigidity paradox in new product innovation (2005) Journal of Marketing, 69 (4), pp. 61-83; Augier, M., Sarasvathy, S.D., Integrating cognition, evolution, and design: extending Simonian perspectives to strategic organization (2004) Strategic Organization, 2 (2), pp. 169-204; Bagozzi, R., Yi, Y., Phillips, L., Assessing construct validity in organizational research (1991) Administrative Science Quarterly, 36 (3), pp. 421-458; Bagozzi, R.P., Phillips, L.W., Representing and testing organizational theories: a holistic construal (1982) Administrative Science Quarterly, 27 (3), pp. 459-490; Barney, J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage (1991) Journal of Management, 17 (1), pp. 99-120; Benner, M.J., Tushman, M.L., Exploitation, exploration, and process management: the productivity dilemma revisited (2003) Academy of Management Review, 28 (2), pp. 238-256; Blindenbach-Driessen, F., Dalen, J., Ende, J., Subjective performance assessment of innovation projects (2010) Journal of Product Innovation Management, 27, pp. 572-592; Bollen, K., Lennox, R., Conventional wisdom on measurement: a structural equation perspective (1991) Psychological Bulletin, 110 (2), pp. 305-314; Bradley, S., Wiklund, J., Shepherd, D., Swinging a double-edge sword: the effect of slack on entrepreneurial management and growth (2010) Journal of Business Venturing, 26 (5), pp. 537-554; Brinckmann, J., Grichnik, D., Kapsa, D., Should entrepreneurs plan or just storm the castle?

Organizations, therefore, are apt subjects to be studied through a science of the artificial. Furthermore, organizational design happens at two interfaces: first, at the interface between organizational founder(s) and the firms they design, and second, between the firms and the environments in which they operate. We use recent developments in the study of entrepreneurial expertise to show why an effectual logic of design is necessary at the first interface, and what its consequences are for designing at the second. In particular, we use the exemplar case of Starbucks to codify three key characteristics of the design problem at the first interface - namely, Knightian uncertainty, goal ambiguity and environmental isotropy. We then use an 'alternate histories' method to trace four strategic options - namely, planning, adaptation, vision and transformation - for designing at the second interface. In the final analysis, organizational design is important because effectuators using transformational approaches not only design organizations, but concurrently end up designing the environments we live in.

Firms and other actors collaborate in formal networks not only to generate new knowledge but also to strategically create and shape supportive system resources such as technology specific R&D programs. This paper takes a closer look at the resources, which are developed and deployed by networks to facilitate the building up of a TIS. Networks rely not only on the organizational resources of their members but also on new resources developed at the network level including network governance structures, trust among network members, a common understanding of the strategic goals or a good reputation of the network. Our analysis shows that the capacity of networks to fulfill different tasks of system building especially depends on the network resources they are able to establish. With the differentiation of organizational, network and system resources we introduce a conceptual framework, which makes three important contributions. It highlights the strategic nature of (innovation) system building; it allows us comparing the contribution of different actors and formal networks in this regard; and it improves our understanding of how firm and system level processes are intertwined. © 2012 Elsevier Inc..","Clean technology; Innovation networks; Network resources; System building; Technological innovation system","Clean technologies; Innovation network; Network resource; System building; Technological innovation; Artificial intelligence; Industry; Innovation; Technology; Buildings; conceptual framework; innovation; knowledge; technological development","Rip, A., Kemp, R., Technological change (1998) Human Choice and Climate Change - Resources and Technology, pp. 327-399. , Battelle Press, Columbus, S.

The existing literature on manufacturing shifting into service is reviewed and, although such moves are seen as a way to increased revenue and profit, there are concerns that firms do not understand how the capabilities that underpin manufacturing may be extended to enable effective service delivery. Inspired by Chase's concept of the 'service factory', which sees the factory as a repository of knowledge and a platform for services, the paper applies Edith Penrose's conception of services as emanating from firms' resources to examine an advanced component manufacturing firm in the course of a number of service-oriented projects. This leads to a model of service development in manufacturing firms, consisting of a network trigger, an opportunity to change the 'productive opportunity', the 'revelation' of resources and Penrose-services, a reconfiguration of the network, leading to an expanded productive opportunity and hence a platform for marketing new service capabilities. In this sense a network is seen as an inter-connected set of productive opportunities. It also draws attention to the importance in theory and practice of understanding both the institutional and the ontological connection between service offerings and the products, factories, firms and networks with which they are associated. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Network; Penrose; Service factory; Service innovation; Servitisation",,"Andersen, P.H., Kragh, H., Sense and sensibility: Two approaches for using existing theory in theory-building qualitative research (2010) Industrial Marketing Management, 39 (1), pp. 49-55; Anderson, J.C., Narus, J.A., Capturing the value of supplementary services (1995) Harvard Business Review, 73 (1), pp. 75-83; Araujo, L., Dubois, A., Gadde, L.-E., The multiple boundaries of the firm (2003) Journal of Management Studies, 40 (5), pp. 1255-1277; Araujo, L., Spring, M., Services, products, and the institutional structure of production (2006) Industrial Marketing Management, 35 (7), pp. 797-805; Baines, T., Lightfoot, H., Peppard, J., Johnson, M., Tiwari, A., Shehab, E., Towards an operations strategy for product-centric servitization (2009) International Journal of Operations & Production Management, 29 (5), pp. 494-519; Baraldi, E., Gressetvold, E., Harrison, D., Resource interaction in inter-organizational networks: Foundations, comparison, and a research agenda (2012) Journal of Business Research, 65 (2), pp. 266-276; Barley, S.R., Technology as an occasion for structuring: Evidence from observations of CT Scanners and the social order of radiology departments (1986) Administrative Science Quarterly, 31 (1), pp. 78-108; Barney, J.B., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage (1991) Journal of Management, 17, pp. 99-120; Barney, J.B., Resource-based theories of competitive advantage: A ten-year retrospective on the resource-based view (2001) Journal of Management, 27 (6), pp. 643-650; Barney, J.B., Ketchen, D.J., Wright, M., The future of resource-based theory (2011) Journal of Management, 37 (5), pp. 1299-1315; Baveja, S.S., Gilbert, J., Ledingham, D., From products to services: Why it's not so simple (2004) Harvard Management Update, 9 (4), pp. 3-5; Bijker, W.E., How is technology made?-That is the question!

We define business networks as sets of connected business relationships. Thus business relationships and connections between relationships are the critical elements in the business network view. It is assumed, as suggested by the Uppsala internationalization process model, that an interplay between knowledge and commitment development is the mechanism that drives the relationship and network development process. Against this background the paper discusses how strategic change is analyzed in literature on alliances and networks. In conclusion the paper presents a set of propositions about strategy-making in business network settings. © 2010 Academy of Marketing Science.","Business networks; Business relationships; Commitment; Learning; Strategic change; Strategy-making",,"Agarwal, R., Helfat, C.E., Strategic renewal of organizations (2009) Organization Science, 20 (2), pp. 281-293; Ahuja, G., The duality of collaboration: inducements and opportunities in the formation of interfirm linkages (2000) Strategic Management Journal, 21, pp. 317-343; Anderson, J.C., Narus, J., A model of the distributor's perspective of distributor-manufacturer working relationships (1984) Journal of Marketing, 48, pp. 62-74; Anderson, J.C., Narus, J., A model of distributor firm and manufacturing firms working partnerships (1990) Journal of Marketing, 54, pp. 42-58; Anderson, E., Weitz, B., The use of pledges to build and sustain commitment in distribution channels (1992) Journal of Marketing Research, 29 (1), pp. 18-34; Anderson, J.C., Håkansson, H., Johanson, J., Dyadic relationships within a business network context (1994) Journal of Marketing, 58 (4), pp. 1-15; Blankenburg, D., Johanson, J., Managing network connections in international business (1992) Scandinavian International Business Review, 1 (1), pp. 5-19; Blankenburg-Holm, D., Eriksson, K., Johanson, J., Creating value through mutual commitment to business network relationships (1999) Strategic Management Journal, 20 (5), pp. 467-486; Burt, R.S., (1992) Structural Holes, , Cambridge: Harvard University Press; Cannon, J.P., Perrault Jr., J.W., Buyer-seller relationships in business markets (1999) Journal of Marketing Research, 36 (4), pp. 439-460; Cook, K.S., Emerson, R.M., Power, equity and commitment in exchange networks (1978) American Sociological Review, 43 (5), pp. 721-738; Cook, K.S., Emerson, R.M., Exchange networks and the analysis of complex organizations (1984) Sociology of Organizations, 3, pp. 1-30; Cunningham, M.T., Homse, E., Controlling the marketing-purchasing interface: resource development and organizational implications (1986) Industrial Marketing and Purchasing, 1 (2), pp. 3-27; Demsetz, H., (1992) Economic, Legal and Political Dimensions of Competititon, , Amsterdam: North Holland; Dwyer, F.R., Schurr, P.H., Oh, S., Developing buyer-seller relationships (1987) Journal of Marketing, 51 (2), pp. 11-27; Dyer, J.H., Hatch, N.W., Relation-specific capabilities and barriers to knowledge transfers: creating advantage through network relationships (2006) Strategic Management Journal, 27, pp. 701-719; Dyer, J.H., Singh, H., The relational view: cooperative strategy and sources of interorganizational competitive advantage (1998) Academy of Management Review, 23 (4), pp. 660-679; Ford, D., The development of buyer-seller relations in industrial markets (1980) European Journal of Marketing, 14 (5-6), pp. 339-353; Ford, D., (1997) Understanding Business Markets, , (Ed.), London: Dryden; Forsgren, M., Kinch, N., (1970) Företagets Anpassning till förändringar I Omgivande System.

Three main research questions are addressed: (1) what OI concepts are salient in their innovation portfolio?, (2) what OI concepts are used in the strategy formulation? and (3) what other concepts are present that augment OI? Interviews with 120 managers and archival documents were analyzed using thematic analysis. Two concepts prominent in the literature, (i) value capture models and (ii) technology evaluation criteria, were not present in this portfolio. By contrast, we found a focus on OI capability building, external information sharing and uncertain knowledge arbitrage in networks. Finally, we discuss these capabilities in relation to absorptive capacity, proposing a simple, but important bi-directional perspective to embrace OI. © 2010 The Authors.

This paper engages with the concept of a design science as it is considered to offer some answers to this enduring debate. The paper goes on to conclude, rather sceptically, that design science may not offer such a distinct perspective on management as a field of study. Our scepticism is based on the design science scholars' rather arbitrary use of Simon's intellectual legacy, particularly the superficial differentiation between explanatory-based and prescriptive-based social sciences, and the promises such a comparison holds for prescriptive outcomes in management. The paper contributes to the design science debate in management by identifying three different types of design, each based on different ways artefacts emerge. These identified differences have profound consequences for understanding design science as an explicitly organized and systematic approach to design. We conclude that later conceptualizations of design science do have a place, but offer only a particular perspective - one that is relevant for a narrow set of organizational phenomena. Finally, we argue that the design analogy is an important one in the current debate about the nature of management studies if it highlights the creation of novelty and disruption of stability. It also offers a way of thinking about the exposition of uncertainty, in contrast to highlighting rules and principles that offer a prescriptive promise to guide the design of social artefacts. © 2009 British Academy of Management.",,,"Adner, R., Helfat, C.E., Corporate effects and dynamic managerial capabilities (2003) Strategic Management Journal, 24, pp. 1011-1025; van Aken, J.E., Management research based on the paradigm of the design sciences: the quest for field-tested and grounded technological rules (2004) Journal of Management Studies, 41, pp. 219-246; van Aken, J.E., Management research as a design science: articulating the research products of mode 2 knowledge production in management (2005) British Journal of Management, 16, pp. 19-36; van Aken, J.E., Design science and organization development interventions: aligning business and humanistic values (2007) Journal of Applied Behavioural Science, 43, pp. 67-88; Astley, W.G., Administrative science as socially constructed truth (1985) Administrative Science Quarterly, 30, pp. 497-513; Augier, M., Kreiner, K., Rationality, imagination and intelligence: some boundaries in human decision-making (2000) Industrial and Corporate Change, 9, pp. 659-679; Augier, M., Sarasvathy, S.D., Integrating evolution, cognition and design: extending Simonian perspectives to strategic organization (2004) Strategic Organization, 2, pp. 169-204; Bamford, G., From analysis/synthesis to conjecture/analysis: a review of Karl Popper's influence on design methodology in architecture (2002) Design Studies, 23, pp. 245-261; Bergson, H., (1912) Creative Evolution, , London, Macmillan; Bettis, R.A., Prahalad, C.K., The dominant logic: retrospective and extension (1995) Strategic Management Journal, 16, pp. 5-17; Bucciarelli, L.L., Between thought and object in engineering design (2002) Design Studies, 23, pp. 219-231; Bunge, M., Philosophical inputs and outputs of technology (1979) The History of Philosophy and Technology, pp. 262-281. , Bugliarello G, Doner DB.

A Behavioral Theory of the Firm.

In this paper, we outline a behavioral theory of the entrepreneurial firm that emphasizes transforming environments rather than acting within extant ones. In particular, we explicate three ideas that parallel key concepts in BTF: (1) accumulating stakeholder commitments under goal ambiguity (in line with a political conception of goals), (2) achieving control (as opposed to managing expectations) through non-predictive strategies, and (3) predominately exaptive (rather than adaptive) orientation. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Based on an in-depth and multiple study of several companies, we analyse the main characteristics of environmental uncertainty - complexity and dynamism - that shape companies' approaches to strategic foresight and uncertainty management. We explore the impact of growing complexity and dynamism on these approaches and the role of prediction and control in their design and implementation. We outline a conceptual framework for strategic foresight activities - and their relationships with decision making under uncertainty - as a planned learning process about the future which enables managers not to know opportunities and threats in advance, but to detect them more promptly and to react more effectively as soon as they start emerging. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Learning; Planning; Strategic decision making; Strategic foresight; Uncertainty","Conceptual frameworks; Decision making under uncertainty; Environmental uncertainty; Learning; Learning process; Main characteristics; Prediction and control; Strategic decision making; Strategic foresight; Uncertainty; Uncertainty management; Industry; Planning; Uncertainty analysis; conceptual framework; decision making; design; prediction; strategic approach; uncertainty analysis","Grant, R.M., Strategic Planning in a Turbulent Environment: Evidence from the oil majors (2003) Strateg.

Based on a review of the extant literature on project selection, termination and deletion decisions, we conducted an in-depth interview study with 19 key informants in 11 multinational firms. We identified three genres of portfolio management decision making: formalist-reactive, intuitive, and integrative. Each genre can be described by a unique set of portfolio management practices. For example, formalist-reactive firms rely on quantitative criteria while intuitive firms prefer qualitative criteria. In addition, each genre has to overcome a unique set of challenges. We discuss the three genres in detail and provide several implications for portfolio management decision making. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Yet entrepreneurial innovation has also meant losses and hardships for some members of society: it is destructive of some stakeholders' wellbeing even as it creates new wellbeing among other stakeholders. Both the positive benefits and negative externalities of innovation are problematic because entrepreneurs initiate new ventures before their private profitability and/or social costs can be fully recognized. In this paper we consider three analytical frameworks within which these issues might be examined: pre-commitments, contractarianism, and an entrepreneurial framework. We conclude that the intersection of stakeholder theory and entrepreneurial innovation is a potentially rich arena for research. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Effectuation; Entrepreneurship; Innovation; Stakeholder",,"Abrams, J.J., Solution to the Problem of Induction: Peirce, Appel and Goodman on the Grue Paradox (2002) Transactions of the Charles S.

Additionally, a historical review of supply chain development is offered along with a comprehensive list of supply chain measures currently in use and a discussion of how those measures align within the overall firm strategy. Design/methodology/approach – Building on knowledge management theory, the paper argues herein that the transitory nature of firmlevel differentiation and the ease with which competitors gain access to each others' business strategies demand that firms stay flexible. It is also argued that translating firm knowledge resources into useable knowledge management capabilities may enable firms to enhance their likelihood of competitive advantage. Findings – Many leading firms drive towards new advantages through supply chain information capturing investments. By capturing data and mining that information, firms are better equipped to identify impending changes in the environment and to adjust their strategies accordingly. Practical implications – Firms that have a developed sense of competiveness are more likely to capture and utilize the increased datum provided by IT investments and more likely to implement that knowledge in a way that leads to operational improvements. As firms pursue global markets, supply chain complexity grows exponentially. Firms will need to respond and operations managers will need to find ways to empirically measure their performance to find improvements. Every investment in supply technology should be driven by an understanding of the inextricably interconnectedness of knowledge management capabilities and the firm's ability to effectively implement its corporate strategies. By emphasizing the interconnection between knowledge management and supply chain technology investments, firms improve their potential for developing a competitive advantage. Originality/value – This paper provides a unique conceptual framework intended to aid researchers and managers develop a more thorough understanding of the linkages between knowledge management capabilities, supply chain technology investments, and overall firm performance. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Knowledge management;

Prior studies found that small firms do not deploy the formalized processes identified as best practice for the management of new product development (NPD) in large firms. To explicate small firms' product innovation, this study uses effectuation theory, which emerged from entrepreneurship research. Effectuation theory discerns two logics of decision-making: causation, assuming that means are selected to attain goals; and effectuation, assuming that goals are created based upon available means. The study used a process research approach, investigating product innovation trajectories in five small firms across 352 total events. Quantitative analyses revealed early effectuation logic, which increasingly turned toward causation logic over time. Further qualitative analyses confirmed the use of both logics, with effectual logic rendering product innovation resource-driven, stepwise, and open-ended, and with causal logic used especially in later stages to set objectives and to plan activities and invest resources to attain objectives. Because the application of effectuation logic differentiates the small firm approaches from mainstream NPD best practices, this study examined how small firms' product innovation processes deployed effectuation logic in further detail. The small firms: (1) made creative use of existing resources; (2) scoped innovations to be realizable with available resources; (3) used external resources whenever and wherever these became available; (4) prioritized existing business over product innovation projects; (5) used loose project planning; (6) worked in steps toward tangible outcomes; (7) iterated the generation, selection, and modification of goals and ideas; and (8) relied on their own customer knowledge and market probing, rather than early market research. Using effectuation theory thus helps us understand how small firm product innovation both resembles and differs from NPD best practices observed in larger firms. Because the combination of effectual and causal principles leverages small firm characteristics and resources, this article concludes that product innovation research should more explicitly differentiate between firms of different sizes, rather than prescribing large firm best practices to small firms. © 2013 Product Development & Management Association.",,"Commerce; Innovation; Investments; Product development; Research; Customer knowledge; External resources; Multimethod studies; New product development; Product innovation; Product innovation process; Qualitative analysis; Small manufacturing firms; Industry","Acs, Z.J., Audretsch, D.B., Innovation in large and small firms: An empirical analysis (1988) American Economic Review, 78 (4), pp. 678-690; Almeida, P., Kogut, B., The exploration of technological diversity and geographic localization in innovation: Start-ups in the semiconductor industry (1997) Small Business Economics, 9 (1), pp. 21-31; Audretsch, D., Van Der Horst, R., Kwaak, T., Thurik, R., (2009) Annual Report on EU Small and Medium-sized Enterprises, , Zoetermeer, the Netherlands: EIM Business & Policy Research, EU, DG Enterprise and Industry; Baker, T., Nelson, R.E., Creating something from nothing: Resource construction through entrepreneurial bricolage (2005) Administrative Science Quarterly, 50 (3), pp. 329-366; Barczak, G., Griffin, A., Kahn, K.B., Trends and drivers of success in NPD practices: Results of the 2003 PDMA best practices study (2009) Journal of Product Innovation Management, 26 (1), pp. 3-23; Biazzo, S., Flexibility, structuration, and simultaneity in new product development (2009) Journal of Product Innovation Management, 26 (3), pp. 336-353; Bougrain, F., Haudeville, B., Innovation, collaboration and SMEs internal research capabilities (2002) Research Policy, 31 (5), pp. 735-747; Brettel, M., Mauer, R., Engelen, A., Küpper, D., Corporate effectuation: Entrepreneurial action and its impact on R&D project performance (2012) Journal of Business Venturing, 27 (2), pp. 167-184; Brouwer, E., Kleinknecht, A., Firm size, small business presence and sales of new products: A micro-econometric analysis (1996) Small Business Economics, 8 (3), pp. 189-201; Carland, J.W., Hoy, F., Boulton, W.R., Carland, J.A.C., Differentiating entrepreneurs from small business owners: A conceptualization (1984) Academy of Management Review, 9 (2), pp. 354-359; Chandy, R.K., Tellis, G.J., The incumbent's curse?

We find evidence that a dominant logic characterized by external orientation, proactiveness, and simplicity of routines significantly influences the performance of entrepreneurial firms in this emerging economy. These dominant logic characteristics of high performers serve as a key intangible resource in transition economies that are characterized by the absence of strong institutions and resource constraints.

The results show that the degree to which strategic planning and succession planning are associated with family firm growth depends on the generation managing the firm. Both forms of planning are most conducive to the growth of first-generation firms; however, neither form of planning confers much growth for second-generation firms. For third-and-beyond-generation firms, the benefits of succession planning appear to reemerge. However, strategic planning is negatively associated with their level of growth. © 2013 Baylor University.",,,"Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., (1991) Multiple regression: Testing an interpreting interactions, , Newbury Park, CA: Sage; Anderson, R.C., Mansi, S.A., Reeb, D.M., Founding family ownership and the agency cost of debt (2003) Journal of Financial Economics, 68, pp. 263-285; Aronoff, C.E., Megatrends in family business (1998) Family Business Review, 11 (3), pp. 181-192; Astrachan, J., Allen, E., Spinelli, S., Wittmeyer, C., (2003) American family business survey, , Springfield, MA and Alfred, NY: George and Robin Raymond Family Business Institute and Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company; Bammens, Y., Voordeckers, W., Van Gils, A., Boards of directors in family firms: A generational perspective (2008) Small Business Economics, 31, pp. 163-180; Baum, C.F., Schaffer, M.E., Stillman, S., (2002) IVENDOG: Stata module to calculate Durbin-Wu-Hausman endogeneity test after ivreg, , Boston: Boston College Department of Economics; Bennedsen, M., Nielsen, K.M., Pérez-González, F., Wofenzon, D., Inside the family firm: The role of families in succession decisions and performance (2007) The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 122 (2), pp. 647-691; Birley, S., Westhead, P., Growth and performance contrasts between ""types"" of small firms (1990) Strategic Management Journal, 11 (7), pp. 535-557; Bliese, P.D., Within-group agreement, non-independence, and reliability (2000) Multilevel theory, research and methods in organizations, pp. 349-381. , In K.J.

However, few studies have considered the factors that might bias an investment decision in a way that is idiosyncratic to a given investor-entrepreneur dyad. We do so in this study. Specifically, we build from the literature on the 'similarity effect' to investigate the extent to which decision-making process similarity (shared between the investor and the entrepreneur) might bias or otherwise impact the investor's evaluation of a new venture investment opportunity. Our findings suggest venture capitalists evaluate more favourably opportunities represented by entrepreneurs who 'think' in ways similar to their own. Moreover, in the presence of decision-making process similarity, the impacts of other factors that inform the investment decision actually change in counter-intuitive ways. © 2011 The Authors.

Learning efficiency then appears a key success factor in this context. We propose theoretical insights as empirical material to understand the organizational mechanisms of such project-learning-based development in high-tech start-up context. On the theoretical side, we articulate three bodies of knowledge: project management, organizational learning, and entrepreneurship. The result is an analytical framework to characterize such development in term of multi-projects management and organizational settings. On the empirical side, we analyze two contrasted case studies. The discussion helps to provide patterns to diagnose maturity level and robustness of new ventures in their development. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA.","Effectuation; Entrepreneurship; Learning; Projects","Information management; Knowledge management; Project management; case studies; Elsevier (CO); European; Exploration projects; High-tech startups; Learning efficiency; New ventures; Organizational Learning (OL); Organizational mechanisms; Project learning; Robust development; Start ups; Start Ups; Education; analytical framework; development project; empirical analysis; entrepreneur; learning; project management; theoretical study","Lenfle, S., Midler, C., Innovation-based competition and the dynamics of design in upstream suppliers (2001) Int J Autom Technol Manage, 2-3, pp. 269-286; Schön, D.A., (1983) The reflective practitioner, , Basic Books; Barthélemy, V., Paris, T., Start-up en quête de business model ou l'art du tâtonnement stratégique (2006) Gérer Comprendre, 84, pp. 4-11; Danneels, E., The Dynamics of Product Innovation and Firm Competences (2002) Strat Manage J, 23, pp. 1095-1121; Bygrave WD.

We explore the process by which ambiguity was reduced in four NPD projects, and propose a model that enhances our understanding of this process. Ambiguity arises as multiple interpretations, and interpretations can be understood as hypotheses, hence these can be tested by using the hypothetical-deductive method (HDM). We present a model showing that ambiguity in NPD projects is efficiently reduced by applying the HDM to test the multiple interpretations that give rise to ambiguity and the assumptions underlying these interpretations. We discuss theoretical implications and the usefulness of the model for practitioners of NPD. © Imperial College Press.","Ambiguity; New product development; Qualitative analysis",,"Aldrich, H., (1999) Organizations Evolving, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications; Brun, E., Saetre, A.S., Gjelsvik, M., Benefits of ambiguity in new product development (2008) International Journal of Innovation and Technology Management, 5 (3), pp. 303-319; Burgelman, R., (2002) Strategy Is Destiny: How Strategy-Making Shapes a Company's Future, , New York, NY: The Free Press; Chalmers, A.F., (2004) What is this Thing Called Science, , Berkshire, UK: Open University Press; Charmaz, K., (2006) Constructing Grounded Theory: A Practical Guide through Qualitative Analysis: Methods for the 21st Century, , London: Sage Publications; Cooper, R.G., Stage-gate systems: A new tool for managing new products (1990) Business Horizons, 33 (3), p. 44; Daft, R.L., Lengel, R.H., Information richness: A new approach to managerial behavior and organizational design (1984) Research in Organizational Behavior, pp. 191-233. , Staw, BM and LL Cummings eds, pp, Greenwich, CT: Jai Press; Daft, R.L., Lengel, R.H., Organizational information requirements, media richness and structural design (1986) Management Science, 32 (5), pp. 554-571; Dougherty, D., Interpretive barriers to successful product innovation in large firms (1992) Organization Science, 3 (2), pp. 179-202; Eisenberg, E., Ambiguity as strategy in organizational communication (1984) Communication Monographs, 51, pp. 227-242; Eisenhardt, K., Building theories from case study research (1989) Academy of Management Review, 14 (4), pp. 532-550; Eisenhardt, K., Tabrizi, B., Accelerating adaptive processes: Product innovation in the global computer industry (1995) Administrative Science Quarterly, 40 (1), pp. 84-110; Føllesdal, D., Hermeneutics and the hypothetical-deductive method (1994) Readings in the Philosophy of Social Science, pp. M-LC,233-245. , Martin, and McIntyre eds, pp, Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press; Galbraith, J., (1977) Organizational Design, , Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley; Glaser, B., Strauss, A., (1967) The Discovery of Grounded Theory: Strategies for Qualitative Research, , New York: Aldine de Gruyter; Khurana, A., Rosenthal, S.R., Integrating the fuzzy front end of new product development (1997) Sloan Management Review, 38 (2), pp. 103-120; Knignt, F.H., (1921) Risk, Uncertainty and Profit, , New York, NY: Houghton Mifflin Comapany; Lane, D., Maxfield, R., Strategy under complexity: Fostering generative relationships (1996) Long Range Planning, 29 (2), pp. 215-231; MacCormack, A., Verganti, R., Managing the sources of uncertainty:mAtching process and context in software development (2003) Journal of Product Innovation Management, 20 (3), pp. 217-232; MacCormack, A., Verganti, R., Iansiti, M., Developing products on 'Internet Time': The anatomy of a flexible development process (2001) Management Science, 47 (1), pp. 133-150; March, J.G., Simon, H., (1958) Organizations, , New York, NY: Wiley; March, J.G., (1994) A Primer on Decision Making: How Decisions Happen, , New York, NY: The Free Press; Mautner, T., (2000) The Penguin Dictionary of Philosophy, , New York, NY: Penguin Books; McCracken, G., (1988) The Long Interview, , Newbury Park: Sage Publications; Merton, R., (1957) Social Theory and Social Structure, , Glencoe, Ill, Free Press; Miles, M.B., Huberman, A.M., (1994) Qualitative Data Analysis, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications; Moenaert, R.K., De Meyer, A., Souder, W.E., Deschoolmeester, D., R&D/Marketing communication during the fuzzy front-end (1995) IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 42 (3), pp. 243-258; Montoya-Weiss, M.M., O'Driscoll, T.M., From experience: Applying performance support technology in the fuzzy front end (2000) Journal of Product Innovation Management, 17 (2), pp. 143-161; Myrup, M., Hein, L., (1987) Integrated Product Development, , London: Springer Verlag; Orton, J.D., From inductive to iterative grounded theory: Zipping the gap between process theory and process data (1997) Scandinavian Journal of Management, 13 (4), pp. 419-438; Popper, K.R., (1959) The Logic of Scientific Discovery, , London: Hutchinson; Popper, K.R., (1963) Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge, , London: Routledge and Kegan Paul; Reid, S., Brentani, U., The fuzzy front end of new product development for discontinuous innovations: A theoretical model (2004) Journal of Product Innovation Management, 21 (3), pp. 170-184; Reinertsen, D.G., Taking the fuzziness out of the fuzzy front end (1999) Research Technology Management, 42 (6), p. 25; Sarasvathy, S.D., Dew, N., New market creation through transformation (2005) Journal of Evolutionary Economics, 15, pp. 533-565; Strauss, A., Corbin, J., (1998) Basics of Qualitative Research.

A significant body of research looking at antecedents to venture performance has identified that entrepreneurial talent variables account for meaningful differences in venture performance and that significant heterogeneity exists across performance measures. These are important issues for institutions and policy makers seeking to achieve specific economic goals (e.g.; survival or growth of ventures, employment or revenue). Using meta-analysis, we integrate this work to view connections between aspects of entrepreneurial talent and different performance outcomes. Our investigation includes 50,045 firms (K of 183 studies) and summarizes 1002 observations of small and medium-sized firms. Analysis of these data yields an unexpectedly weak connection between education and performance. Furthermore, growth, scale (number of employees) and sales outcomes are significantly related to planning skills, while profit and other financial and qualitative measures are strongly connected with the network surrounding the firm founders. Moreover, we observe that entrepreneurial talent is more relevant in developing economies. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

For many large organisations today, the tendency to apply a "" one-size-fits-all"" strategy to members of a stakeholder population, commonly driven by a desire for simplicity, efficiency and fairness, may actually result in unanticipated consequences amongst specific subgroups within the target population. This study argues that it is critical for organisations to understand the varying and potentially harmful effects of strategic actions across differing, and previously unidentified, segments within a stakeholder population. The case of a European revenue service that currently focuses its strategic actions on building trust and compliant behaviour amongst taxpayers is used as the context for this study. FIMIX-PLS analysis is applied to a sample of 501 individual taxpayers, while a novel PLS-based approach for assessing measurement model invariance that can be applied to both reflective and formative measures is also introduced for the purpose of multi-group comparisons. The findings suggest that individual taxpayers can be split into two equal-sized segments with highly differentiated characteristics and reactions to organisational strategy and communications. Compliant behaviour in the first segment (n = 223), labelled "" relationships centred on trust,"" is mainly driven through positive service experiences and judgements of competence, while judgements of benevolence lead to the unanticipated reaction of increasing distrust among this group. Conversely, compliant behaviour in the second segment (n = 278), labelled "" relationships centred on distrust,"" is driven by the reduction of fear and scepticism towards the revenue service, which is achieved through signalling benevolence, reduced enforcement and the lower incidence of negative stories. In this segment, the use of enforcement has the unanticipated and counterproductive effect of ultimately reducing compliant behaviour. © 2012.",,"Efficiency and fairness; Harmful effects; Measurement model; Multi-group; Revenue services; Service experience; Enterprise resource planning; Finance; Taxation; stakeholder; strategic approach; Europe","Ackermann, F., Eden, C., Strategic management of stakeholders: theory and practice (2011) Long Range Planning, 44 (3), pp. 179-196; Afonso, A., Schuknecht, L., Tanzi, V., Public sector efficiency: an international comparison (2005) Public Choice, 123 (3), pp. 321-347; Andersson, L.M., Bateman, T.S., Cynicism in the workplace: some causes and effects (1997) Journal of Organisational Behaviour, 18 (5), pp. 449-469; Balogun, J., Managing change: steering a course between intended strategies and unanticipated outcomes (2006) Long Range Planning, 39 (1), pp. 29-49; Barney, J.B., Hansen, M.H., Trustworthiness as a source of competitive advantage (1994) Strategic Management Journal, 15 (S1), pp. 175-190; Bierly, P.E., Gallagher, S., Explaining alliance partner selection: fit, trust and strategic expediency (2007) Long Range Planning, 40 (2), pp. 134-153; Boyatzis, R.E., Jack, A., Cesaro, R., Passarelli, A., Khawaja, M., Coaching with Compassion: An fMRI Study of Coaching to the Positive or Negative Emotional Attractor (2010) Academy of Management Proceedings; Boyd, D.E., Spekman, R.E., Kamauff, J.W., Werhane, P., Corporate social responsibility in global supply chains: a procedural justice perspective (2007) Long Range Planning, 40 (3), pp. 341-356; Boyne, G.A., Public and private management: what's the difference?

In addition, contingencies under which one may be more appropriate than the other for optimal performance consequences are identified. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative study was conducted with UK exporters by way of in-depth interviews. The results were analyzed using within- and cross-case displays of in-vivo and literature-based codes, based on Miles and Huberman's recommendations. Findings: The study reveals widespread use of improvisation in export functions, and its co-existence with export planning for enhanced decision-making. In addition, resource- and capabilities-based moderators are identified that may affect the ways in which planning and improvisation are related to export performance. Research limitations/implications: This is a preliminary study which addresses the two export decision-making orientations together for the first time. Further quantitative research is needed to formally test the conceptual model developed. Practical implications: Export decision-makers often feel guilty about improvising, believing that planning is the accepted norm. Avoidance and covert use of improvisation, however, are not necessary. Indeed, export improvisation can have many positive consequences for the export function, especially when combined with export planning. Originality/value: Research on export decision-making has tended to focus on normative decision theory (from which planning emerges), largely overlooking descriptive approaches which identify improvisation as a valid decision-making orientation. However, in today's global and competitive environment, better performance consequences are increasingly to be found in the faster and more creative export decisions that improvisation can afford. This study addresses for the first time how benefits can be drawn from employing a combination of export planning and improvisation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Decision making; Exports; United Kingdom",,"Aaby, N., Slater, S.F., Management influences on export performance: A review of the empirical literature 1978-88 (1989) International Marketing Review, 6 (4), pp. 7-26; Ansoff, H.I., (1965) Corporate Strategy, , Macmillan, New York, NY; Ashton, A.H., The descriptive validity of normative decision theory in auditing contexts (1982) Journal of Accounting Research, 20 (2), pp. 415-428; Auh, S., Menguc, B., Performance implications of the direct and moderating effects of centralization and formalization on customer orientation (2007) Industrial Marketing Management, 36 (8), pp. 1022-1034; Baker, T., Nelson, R.E., Creating something from nothing: Resource construction through entrepreneurial bricolage (2005) Administrative Science Quarterly, 50 (3), pp. 329-366; Baker, T., Miner, A.S., Eesley, D.T., Improvising firms: Bricolage, account giving and improvisational competencies in the founding process (2003) Research Policy, 32 (2), pp. 255-276; Bakken, B.E., On improving dynamic decision-making: Implications from multiple-process cognitive theory (2008) Systems Research and Behavioral Science, 25 (4), pp. 493-501; Barney, J.B., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage (1991) Journal of Management, 17 (1), pp. 99-120; Barr, P.S., Current and potential importance of qualitative methods in strategy research (2004) Research Methodology in Strategy and Management, 1, pp. 165-188. , Ketchen, D.J.

Yet, surprisingly, they have received little serious attention. This book provides a sober and evidence-based assessment, charting the history and character of business schools in the light of current debates about the role of universities and the evolution of advanced economies. Previous commentators have viewed business schools as falling between two stools: lacking in academic rigour yet simultaneously derided by the corporate world as broadly irrelevant. However, over-concern with criticism risks ignoring the benefits of reform. What business schools need is reconfiguration based on new relationships with academia and business. Such change would deliver institutions that are truly fit for purpose, allowing them to become key players in the 21st century's emergent knowledge societies. This timely critique should be read by academics and policy-makers concerned with the present state and future development of business education. © Ken Starkey and Nick Tiratsoo 2007 and Cambridge University Press, 2010.",,,"Crainer, S., Dearlove, D., (1998) Gravy Training: Inside the Shadowy World of Business Schools, 9, p. 2. , Oxford: Capstone; Clark, K., Grading the m.B.a. president (2006) U.S. News and World Report, , 3 April; Bradshaw, D., Dardens dean finds inspiration in socrates’ (2006) Financial Times, , 16 July; Hubbard, G., Do not undervalue the impact of business education (2006) Financial Times, , 28 July; Broughton, P.D., A lesson in moral leadership (2005) Financial Times, , 25 April; Palmer, P., Billionaire benefactors who fell to earth (And why the royal opera house and imperial college are left feeling rather embarrassed) (2005) Evening Standard, , 23 June; Simpkins, E., School for scoundrels?

We observe that the type of decision-making process hinges on the nature of managers' emerging awareness of future events. When managers become aware of new uncertainty, the process involves selectiveness, deliberateness, and diligence. By contrast, when managers become aware of new certainty, the process conforms to the problem-solving adhocracy and decision-making messiness emphasized in prior literature. We summarize our findings in a framework, proposing that decision-level differences in awareness and uncertainty can explain the observed variation in strategic decision-making processes during implementation. We also discuss implications for theory on procedural rationality and analytical comprehensiveness. © 2013 INFORMS.","Awareness; Decision-making processes; Implementation; Strategic decision making; Strategic initiatives; Uncertainty",,"Atuahene-Gima, K., Li, H.Y., Strategic decision comprehensiveness and new product development outcomes in new technology ventures (2004) Acad.

Based on Sarasvathy's (Acad Manage Rev 26(2):243-288, 2001) seminal study, causation is defined as a decision-making process that focuses on what ought to be done given predetermined goals and possible means, and effectuation as a decision-making process emphasizing the question of what can be done given possible means and imagined ends. Analysis suggests that entrepreneurs who identify themselves with linear or expert career motives have a higher preference for causal decision-making logic. Entrepreneurs who identify themselves with spiral or transitory career motives have a higher preference for effectual decision-making logic. In addition, indications that prior start-up experience moderates the relationship between career motives and effectual decision-making logic for spiral-minded entrepreneurs is found. The overall results give ample support for the assumption that entrepreneurs' career motives influence their decision-making. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Career experience; Career motives; Effectuation; Entrepreneurial decision-making",,"Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., (1991) Multiple Regression: Testing and Interpreting Interactions, , Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications; Amit, R., Maccrimmon, K.R., Zietsma, C., Oesch, J.M., Does money matter? - Wealth attainment as the motive for initiating growth-oriented technology ventures (2001) Journal of Business Venturing, 16 (2), pp. 119-143; Argyris, C., Schön, D., (1974) Theory in Practice: Increasing Professional Effectiveness, , San Francisco: Jossey Bass; Baron, R.A., Cognitive mechanisms in entrepreneurship: Why and when entrepreneurs think differently than other people (1998) Journal of Business Venturing, 13 (4), pp. 275-294; Baron, R.A., Opportunity recognition as pattern recognition: How entrepreneurs ""connect the dots"" to identify new business opportunities (2006) Academy of Management Perspectives, 20 (1), pp. 104-119; Bird, B.J., (1989) Entrepreneurial Behavior, , Glenview, ILL: Scott, Foresman and Company; Boeker, W., Strategic change: The effects of founding and history (1988) Academy of Management Journal, 32 (3), pp. 489-515; Brousseau, K.R., Job-person dynamics and career development (1984) Research in Personnel and Human Resources, 2, pp. 125-154. , K.

Our analysis utilises corporate documents produced prior to a scenario-based intervention, pre-scenario-development interviews with members of the top management team, and knowledge of post-intervention events. We conclude that, even in the face of strong, orchestrated pressure for a re-think of a fragile strategy, the aspirations of the CEO were dominant. Our case analysis illustrates that inertia in strategic decision making can be extreme-more extreme than the extant literature has recognised. Critical voices can go unheard.

By contrast, we consider how different epistemologies within organizations, or combinations of epistemologies, and the degree to which the environment is amenable to organizational control jointly affect learning over time. This study presents three different epistemologies expressed in interpersonal learning: pragmatism (learning beliefs from better performers), coherentism (learning beliefs that fit together), and conformism (adopting beliefs that are popular). We also examine the learning implications of a dominant coalition that can promulgate its preferred beliefs throughout an organization. Outcomes from our agent-based model point toward key epistemological and environmental contingencies affecting the dynamics of organizational learning. Organizations filled with pragmatists learn effectively if the environment is fixed or controllable. Coherentists and conformists advance in knowledge only to the extent that they can control the environment. Adding pragmatists to organizations with coherentists or conformists produces a nonlinear (S-shaped) effect on knowledge achieved as different proportions of pragmatists alter social networks. Models involving learning from a dominant coalition affirm March's trade-off between learning speed and eventual knowledge achieved only for organizations filled with pragmatists and operating in an uncontrollable environment. © 2010 INFORMS.","Agent-based model; Computer simulation; Epistemology; Ontology; Organizational learning; Social construction",,"Allen, T.J., (1977) Managing the Flow of Technology: Technology Transfer and the Dissemination of Technological Information within the R&D Organization, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Alvarez, S.A., Barney, J.B., Discovery and creation: Alternative theories of entrepreneurial action (2007) Strategic Entrepreneurship J, 1, pp. 11-26; Audi, R., (2003) Epistemology: A Contemporary Introduction to the Theory of Knowledge, , 2nd ed.

Scenario/contingency planning is a tool used by firms to translate their organizational learning capabilities into preconceived operational responses designed to react to, and then recover from, an exogenous shock. The use of scenario planning that includes exogenous shock scenarios has become a best practice in many industries.

The purpose of this paper is to understand how entrepreneurs successfully create such upstart firms and new markets, since this ought to have direct implications for theorizing about the innovator's dilemma. Design/methodology/approach – The paper examines implications of recent studies in entrepreneurial expertise that show expert entrepreneurs use an effectual logic of non-predictive control. It then connects these ideas to notions of firms and markets as artifacts of entrepreneurial action. Finally, it describes the implications of these concepts for the innovation strategies of large corporations, and specifically for firms periodically facing the innovator's dilemma. Findings – The findings suggest that the practical answer to the innovator's dilemma is not to predict technology trajectories more accurately, or otherwise strive to build immortal firms in mortal markets. Instead, innovation managers should focus on building new markets. This will inevitably involve pluralizing decision-making technologies by including some aspects of effectual decision making (used by expert entrepreneurs) into the decision-making processes of large firms. Originality/value – It is the basic contention of this paper that the innovator's dilemma is not the story it is usually portrayed as, i.e. technology commercialization. Instead, the core issue is investing in and building new markets. The paper brings a novel theoretical framework (from entrepreneurship) to bear on this problem. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Customer orientation; Entrepreneurialism; Market driven production; Product innovation",,"Assink, M., Inhibitors of disruptive innovation capability: a conceptual model (2006) European Journal of Innovation Management, 9, pp. 215-233; Aversi, R., Dosi, G., Fagliolo, G., Meacci, M., Olivetti, C., Demand dynamics and socially evolving preferences (1999) Industrial and Corporate Change, 2, pp. 353-408; Carpenter, G.S., Nakamoto, K., Consumer preference formation and pioneering advantage (1989) Journal of Marketing Research, 26, pp. 285-298; Casson, M., (1982) The Entrepreneur: An Economic Theory, , Routledge, Cheltenham; Chandy, R.K., Tellis, G.J., The incumbent's curse?

Prior literature posits that effectuation is linked to opportunity creation when the venture's future is highly uncertain and causation to opportunity recognition when the entrepreneur perceives risk rather than uncertainty. However, such a linear approach towards opportunity generation offers limited explanation as to how entrepreneurs decide to either create or search for entrepreneurial opportunities. This limitation becomes particularly apparent in the highly uncertain context of the biotechnology industry, where entrepreneurial decision-making processes iterate over long periods of time. To address this gap, we employ the embedded case study method to investigate 30 decisions made by three scientist-entrepreneurs commercializing platform biotechnology inventions. We inductively derive a model of entrepreneurial decision-making, which connects the environment to decision-making mode and opportunity generation. Our evidence reveals the iterative nature of opportunity generation and of decision-making modes as entrepreneurs respond to their evolving environment and to the level of regulatory and funding constraint, such that entrepreneurs can shift from effectuation to causation, remain in one particular mode, or adopt a combination mode. We also illustrate that effectuation does not always lead to opportunity creation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper we critically evaluate some Austrian ideas on the firm, with particular attention to the concept of entrepreneurial judgment. We then describe recent empirical work in entrepreneurship that has identified key elements of what might reside inside the ""black box"" of entrepreneurial decision making. We conclude that expertise in this type of decision making embodies procedural knowledge that is adaptive in the absence of substantive knowledge, i.e. without judgment. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Austrian capital theory; Effectuation; Entrepreneurship; Judgment; Microfoundations",,"Adaman, F., Devine, P., A reconsideration of the theory of entrepreneurship: A participatory approach (2002) Review of Political Economy, 14 (3), pp. 329-355; Adelstein, R., Knowledge and power in the mechanical firm: Planning for profit in Austrian perspective (2005) The Review of Austrian Economics, 18 (1), pp. 55-82; Allison, G., Zelikow, P., (1999) Essence of decision, , New York: Longman; Alvarez, S.A., Barney, J.B., How do entrepreneurs organize firms under conditions of uncertainty?

We argue for the benefits of an alternative method that views uncertainty as originating from indeterminism. We develop and illustrate an 'antifragile' approach to preparing for the future and present it as a step-by-step, non-deterministic methodology that can be used as a replacement for, or as a complement to, the causally-focused approach of scenario planning. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Causality; Fragility; Indeterminism; Intuitive Logics; Scenario planning; Uncertainty",,"Bradfield, R., Wright, G., Burt, G., Cairns, G., Van Der Heijden, K., The origins and evolution of scenario techniques in long range business planning (2005) Futures, 37, pp. 795-812; Evans, S.K., Connecting adaptation and strategy: the role of evolutionary theory in scenario planning (2011) Futures, 43, pp. 460-468; Chermack, T.J., Swanson, R.A., Scenario planning: human resource development's strategic learning tool (2008) Adv.

This two-year field research was seen as an ideal vehicle for investigating why a group within a firm proactively engages with a pattern of capability development, how such proactive engagement is conducted, and what these proactive activities are. I assert that autonomous action originates from intra-firm heterogeneity of group-level cognitive frames and social identities. The evidence suggests that a group with a particularly distinct perception of the strategic value of a capability will be more likely to initiate autonomous action with the aim of making an impact on capability development. The likelihood of autonomous action increases further if a group acts to strengthen the distinctiveness of its own identity by raising the perceived value of a capability that compares unfavourably with other firms' capabilities. The field observations suggest that in circumstances of high inter-group dependency and limited group authority, the group attempts to make an impact on capability development by adopting creative and socially complex framing practices. The group formalizes a collective and cognitive search process in order to legitimize the preferred action and subtly sells the issue to higher authority without causing conflict, while still sustaining the group's intent. © 2010 The Author.

Building on the innovation, strategy, and managerial cognition literatures, we use a conjoint field experiment to collect data on 4032 decisions made by 126 R&D managers to test how project attributes, strategic context, and managers' characteristics influence innovation exploitation decisions. Using hierarchical linear modeling, we find that (1) experience impacts project exploitation decision policies of middle managers more than senior managers, (2) divergent thinking across middle and senior managers increases with experience, and (3) experienced middle managers diverge from experienced senior managers in their decisions to exploit opportunities by placing greater emphasis on strategic context (relative to competitors and fit within the portfolio) and lesser emphasis on uncertainty (technological and demand). These findings have implications for the strategy and innovation literature. © 2013 Product Development & Management Association.",,"Management; Decision policy; Divergent thinkings; Field experiment; Hierarchical linear modeling; Managerial cognitions; Middle managers; Research and development; Senior managers; Managers","Amason, A.C., Distinguishing the effects of functional and dysfunctional conflict on strategic decision making: Resolving a paradox for top management teams (1996) Academy of Management Journal, 39 (1), pp. 123-148; Atuahene-Gima, K., Li, H., Strategic decision comprehensiveness and new product development outcomes in new technology ventures (2004) Academy of Management Journal, 47 (4), pp. 583-597; Balogun, J., Johnson, G., Organizational restructuring and middle manager sensemaking (2004) Academy of Management Journal, 47 (4), pp. 523-549; Baron, R.A., Ensley, M.D., Opportunity recognition as the detection of meaningful patterns: Evidence from comparisons of novice and experienced entrepreneurs (2006) Management Science, 52 (9), pp. 1331-1344; Baron, R.A., Henry, R.A., How entrepreneurs acquire the capacity to excel: Insights from research on expert performance (2010) Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal, 4 (1), pp. 49-65; Beck, T.E., Plowman, D.A., Experiencing rare and unusual events richly: The role of middle managers in animating and guiding organizational interpretation (2009) Organization Science, 20 (5), pp. 909-924; Burgelman, R.A., A process model of internal corporate venturing in the diversified major firm (1983) Administrative Science Quarterly, 28 (2), pp. 223-244; Burgelman, R.A., Fading memories: A process theory of strategic business exit in dynamic environments (1994) Administrative Science Quarterly, 39 (1), pp. 24-56; Chao, R.O., Kavadias, S., A theoretical framework for managing the new product development portfolio: When and how to use strategic buckets (2008) Management Science, 54 (5), pp. 907-923; Chase, W., Simon, H., Perception in chess (1973) Cognitive Psychology, 4 (1), pp. 55-81; Cooper, R., Edgett, S., Kleinschmidt, E., Portfolio management for new product development: Results of an industry practices study (2001) R&D Management, 31 (4), pp. 361-380; Cooper, R., Kleinschmidt, E., Benchmarking the firm's critical success factors in new product development (1995) Journal of Product Innovation Management, 12, pp. 374-391; Cooper, R.G., Perspective: The stage gate idea-to-launch process - Update, what's new, and NexGen Systems (2008) Journal of Product Innovation Management, 25, pp. 213-232; Cooper, R.G., Edgett, S.J., Kleinschmidt, E.J., New product portfolio management: Practices and performance (1999) Journal of Product Innovation Management, 16 (4), pp. 333-351; Davies, J., Easterby Smith, M., Learning and developing from managerial work experiences (1984) Journal of Management Studies, 21 (2), pp. 169-182; Dew, N., Read, S., Sarasvathy, S.D., Wiltbank, R., Effectual versus predictive logics in entrepreneurial decision-making: Differences between experts and novices (2009) Journal of Business Venturing, 24 (4), pp. 287-309; Di Benedetto, C.A., Identifying the key success factors in new product launch (1999) Journal of Product Innovation Management, 16 (6), pp. 530-540; Dokko, G., Wilk, S.L., Rothbard, N.P., Unpacking prior experience: How career history affects job performance (2009) Organization Science, 20 (1), pp. 51-68; Dragoni, L., Tesluk, P.E., Russell, J.E.A., Oh, I.S., Understanding managerial development: Integrating developmental assignments, learning orientation, and access to developmental opportunities in predicting managerial competencies (2009) The Academy of Management Journal, 52 (4), pp. 731-743; Edmondson, A.C., Winslow, A.B., Bohmer, R.M.J., Pisano, G.P., Learning how and learning what: Effects of tacit and codified knowledge on performance improvement following technology adoption (2003) Decision Sciences, 34 (2), pp. 197-224; Fischhoff, B., Gonzalez, R.M., Lerner, J.S., Small, D.A., Evolving judgments of terror risks: Foresight, hindsight, and emotion (2005) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, 11 (2), pp. 124-139; Floyd, S., Lane, P., Strategizing throughout the organization: Managing role conflict in strategic renewal (2000) Academy of Management Review, 25 (1), pp. 154-177; Floyd, S., Wooldridge, B., Middle management involvement in strategy and its association with strategic type: A research note (1992) Strategic Management Journal, 13, pp. 153-167; Floyd, S.W., Wooldridge, B., Middle management's strategic influence and organizational performance (1997) Journal of Management Studies, 34 (3), pp. 465-485; Forbes, D.P., Are some entrepreneurs more overconfident than others?

Our research is based on a multiple-case study of corporate organisations that recently faced major changes in their external environment and increasing turbulence. We expand our understanding of environmental uncertainty by defining the concept of 'boundary uncertainty', which regards the identity of the components of the business (micro) environment. We distinguish between 'continuous' and 'discontinuous' drivers of change and find that they entail different requirements for the design and implementation of strategic foresight actions. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","environmental uncertainty; learning; planning; strategic foresight; strategic management","corporate strategy; decision making; learning; management practice","Ansoff, H.I., Critique of Henry Mintzberg's 'The design school': Reconsidering the basic premises of strategic management (1991) Strategic Management Journal, 12 (6), pp. 449-461; Becker, P., Corporate foresight in Europe: A first overview (2002) RTD K-2 Scientific and Technological Foresight, , Brussels: European Commission; Bradley, M.R., Costanzo, L.A., Introduction (2009) In Handbook of research on strategic foresight, , ed.

While useful in many respects, this perspective obscures the uncertainty of emerging organizational phenomena, and it offers little insight into the rare and unpredictable events that change the course of history. To address these concerns, we draw on quantum mechanics and quantum probability theories to present a quantum approach to time and change as a framework for understanding organizational complexity and the common decision-making errors that lead to organizational failures within uncertain environments. This perspective also explains how organizations (or societies) can experience unforeseen potentialities that radically change their development by conceptualizing the future as existing in a state of potentiality that collapses to form the present based on the dynamics of system constraints. Our theory has broad implications for organizational theory and research, as well as management practice. © Academy of Management Review.",,,"Aime, F., Humphrey, S., DeRue, D.S., Paul, J.B., The riddle of heterarchy: Power transitions in crossfunctional teams (2014) Academy of Management Journal, 57, pp. 327-352; Alvesson, M., Sandberg, J., Generating research questions through problematization (2011) Academy of Management Review, 36, pp. 247-271; Ancona, D.G., Goodman, P.S., Lawrence, B.S., Tushman, M.L., Time: A new research lens (2001) Academy of Management Review, 26, pp. 645-663; Arkes, H.R., Faust, D., Gulimette, T.J., Hart, K., Eliminating the hindsight bias (1988) Journal of Applied Psychology, 73, pp. 305-307; Arrfelt, M., Wiseman, R.M., Hult, G.T.M., Looking backward instead of aspiration-driven influences on the capital allocation process (2013) Academy of Management Journal, 56, pp. 1081-1103; Bakken, T., Hernes, T., Organizing is both a verb and a noun: Weick meets Whitehead (2006) Organization Studies, 27, pp. 1599-1616; Bargh, J.A., Chen, M., Burrows, L., Automaticity of social behavior: Direct effects of trait construct and stereotype activation on action (1996) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 71, pp. 230-244; Barsalou, L.W., Ad hoc categories (1983) Memory & Cognition, 11, pp. 211-227; Barsalou, L.W., Niedenthal, P.M., Barbey, A., Ruppert, J., Social embodiment (2003) Psychology of Learning and Motivation, 43, pp. 43-92; Bledow, R., Rosing, K., Frese, M., A dynamic perspective on affect and creativity (2013) Academy of Management Journal, 56, pp. 432-450; Bluedorn, A.C., Jaussi, K.S., Leaders, followers, and time (2008) Leadership Quarterly, 19, pp. 654-668; Bobko, P., Roth, P.L., Buster, M.A., The usefulness of unit weights in creating composite scores: A literature review, application to content validity, and meta-analysis (2007) Organizational Research Methods, 10, pp. 689-709; Boroditsky, L., Ramscar, M., The roles of body and mind in abstract thought (2002) Psychological Science, 13, pp. 185-189; Brown, D., Marchioro, C., Tan, J.A., Lord, R.G., (1998) Annual Meeting of the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology, Dallas, , Individual difference variables and leadership perceptions: Linear or catastrophic relationship?

By integrating mainstream marketing thinking with the emergent marketing literature that acknowledges a set of shortcomings related to the neoclassical-based market conceptualization, this paper aims to provide a market conceptualization that captures complexity. Grounded on the etymology of the word market, we review literature and identify two market dimensions: market-as-noun and market-as-verb; and four distinct themes: market entities (referring to which actors are involved), market representation (regarding how markets are signified), market performing (referring to what actions are carried out), and market sense-making (concerning how markets emerge and evolve). Each theme has several elements. The proposed market conceptualization allows market complexity to be addressed by integrating conventional and new market forms. It also offers new avenues for research and invites managers to emancipate themselves from product-based market thinking, to create subjective market definitions and to think in terms of non-predictive strategies. © 2014, Academy of Marketing Science.","Market; Market complexity; Market conceptualization; Market driving; Market shaping",,"Achrol, R.S., Kotler, P., Frontiers of the marketing paradigm in the third millennium (2012) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 40 (1), pp. 35-52; Alderson, W., (1957) Marketing behavior and executive action, , Richard D.

When designing building structures, one must take into account the mutual interrelations between various systems and the readiness for changes during the lifecycle of building structures. The issue of flexibility is presented using the example of a buffer parking lot which was analyzed with regards to its economic efficiency, using a hybrid method and, simultaneously, the NPV method and a simulation. Traditional designing processes have certain shortcomings as they are most often based on one value, identified using deterministic methods, while flexible approach to design enables adopting infrastructure to the changing conditions occurring during its lifecycle. © 2013 The Authors.","Buffer parking; Construction industry; Design; Flexibility; Infrastructure; Net present value; Simulation",,"Slowik, M., Modelling of the inverse creep of road bitumen modified with SBS copolymer (2012) Baltic Journal of Road and Bridge Engineering, 7 (1), pp. 68-75. , http://dx.doi.org/10.3846/bjrbe.2012.10; Ustinovichius, L., Rasiulis, R., Ignatavičius, C., Vilutien, T., Analysis of waterproofing defects and technology development for car parking roofs: Lithuanian case (2012) Journal of Civil Engineering and Management, 18 (4), pp. 519-529. , http://dx.doi.org/10.3846/13923730.2012.701231; Gajzler, M., Neural networks in the advisory system for repairs of industrial concrete floors (2011) Computer Assisted Mechanics and Engineering Sciences, 18 (4), pp. 255-263; Blaszczynski, T.Z., The influence of crude oil product on RC structure destruction (2011) Journal of Civil Engineering and Management, 17, pp. 146-156. , http://dx.doi.org/10.3846/13923730.2011.561522; Joseph, O.A., Sridharan, R., Effects of flexibility and scheduling decisions on the performance of an FMS: Simulation modelling and analysis (2012) International Journal of Production Research, 50 (7), pp. 2058-2078. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2011.575091; Volberda, H., Building the flexible firm (1998) How to Remain Competitive, , http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198295952.001.0001, Oxford University Press; Das, K., Integrating effective flexibility measures into a strategic supply chain planning model (2011) European Journal of Operational Research, 211 (1), pp. 170-183. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2010.12.006; De Groote, X., The flexibility of production process: A general framework (1994) Management Science, 40, pp. 933-945. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.40.7.933; Upton, D.M., (1994) The Management of Manufacturing Flexibility, California Management Review, Winter, pp. 72-89; Bucki, J., Pesqueux, Y., Flexible workshop: About the concept of flexibility (2000) International Journal of Agile Management Systems, 2, pp. 62-70. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/14654650010312615; Wadhwa, S., Rao, K.S., A unified framework for manufacturing and supply chain flexibility (2004) Global Journal of Flexible Systems Management, 5, pp. 15-22; Wiltbank, R., Dew, N., Read, S., Sarasvathy, S.D., What to do next?

It argues that ABM allows entrepreneurship researchers (i.e. the designers) to find better ways in generating entrepreneurial outcomes by understanding alternative histories and examining a plausible future. Design/methodology/approach: This paper begins with an overview of ABM, and discusses the shared conceptual foundations of entrepreneurship and ABM as the motives for the adoption of ABM as an appropriate methodology to study entrepreneurship. It offers a roadmap in using ABM approach for entrepreneurship research and illustrates this using a contemporary research question in entrepreneurship: the study of success/failure in business venturing. Findings: This paper suggests the shared foundations between ABM and entrepreneurship as the basis for bringing the methodology and research domain closer. It offers a roadmap for advancing entrepreneurship research using agent-based simulation approach and explains the contribution of ABM to further advance entrepreneurship research. Originality/value: This paper addresses the methodological gap in entrepreneurship research and develops the argument for a wider adoption of ABM simulation approach to study entrepreneurship. It bridges the gap by examining the possibility of formalizing entrepreneurship processes by grounding an agent-based model on empirical facts and generally-accepted foundations of entrepreneurship. It offers a contribution to the literature by showing that ABM is a useful and appropriate methodological approach for entrepreneurship research in addition to the conventional variance and process approach. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Agent-based modelling; Effectuation; Entrepreneurialism; Entrepreneurs; Entrepreneurship; Simulation",,"Adner, R., Levinthal, D., Doing versus seeing: Acts of exploitation and perceptions of exploration (2008) Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal, 2 (2), pp. 43-52; Aldrich, H.E., Who wants to be an evolutionary theorist?

While this research has improved our understanding of how large corporations are governed, corporate governance in small and medium sized enterprises, and in particular in entrepreneurial firms, has rarely been studied. While academia, managers, and policy makers are deeply concerned with how many jobs are created by new ventures, how much they should invest, and how much wealth they generate. In particular they are concerned in their local and national economy, for there is only scarce evidence on how entrepreneurial firms can and should organize their factors of production in a way that promotes success, and how they are governed. With the emergence of the ""New Economy"" that is step-by-step replacing the ""Managed Economy,"" governance problems in these entrepreneurial firms appear. This essay offers a reflective overview of corporate governance mechanisms in entrepreneurial firms and offers an explanation on how and why they may differ from those mechanisms in large and publicly traded corporations. We develop a conceptual framework that may help to analyze corporate governance mechanisms in entrepreneurial firms, but it may also serve as a work-horse (leading example) that compares this special kind of firm with others, like medium sized firms or large private companies with dispersed shareholders. This essay differs from previous research in two ways. First, we try to capture the mechanisms of corporate governance within an interval ranging from purely market mechanisms over contractual agreements to strong hierarchical elements, like boards. This refers to entrepreneurial firms in our setting, ranging from the single entrepreneur and single-owner-manager toward the owner-manager of a firm with tangible assets and employees. Second, we try to integrate the (micro)economic and financial theories with the management perspective. More literally, the skeleton of our framework is theoretical arguments from the economics and finance literature, while the management perspective, and in particular the entrepreneurship literature, provides the beef. We also try to discuss aspects of which we so far do not know, and identify several ideas to stimulate future research on this important and growing topic. This future research could easily be summarized in two sentences: where we observe plenty of empirical studies, most cross-sectional, we need Meta-Analysis to highlight and extract statistically significant factors - ""what we know."" And, where there is only scarce empirical evidence about the interrelation of variables, complementarities, or substitutive relationships across factors and countries we need more in-depth studies, both theoretically and empirically, either quantitative or qualitative: ""what we do not know""! © 2014 D.

The construction business, however, when compared to many other branches of industry, is characterized by considerable operational risk. Therefore it seems that a direct impact on risk through implementation of flexibility with the proactiveness priority taken into account at the operational (source) level is a unique chance for successful risk management in the construction process engineering. The flexibility is understood in this case as the ability of an organization executing construction processes to adjust to dynamically changing environment through preparation of alternative variants (options), easy to switch over to. The specific character of implementation of flexibility has been illustrated with an example of repairing a road construction structure, with dissimilarity of that application to typical situations being emphasized.","Construction;

Specifically, it asks how firms can create products when the corresponding market does not exist. Design/methodology/approach - This paper is based on a longitudinal study of a high-tech firm, combined with analysis of existing theory in product design and entrepreneurship. Findings - Markets and products are usually a defining choice made early on by firms in their strategic process. Such a choice guides their development by providing a ""stable concept"" to which decisions can be related. When markets do not exist yet, however, this approach is not effective. Early choice of products and markets limits firms' flexibility by constraining their ability and willingness to adapt, while fundamental new technical and market information is likely to emerge during the project that will prove the initial assumptions wrong. The paper shows an alternative approach where products and markets actually result from a generic process of products and markets exploration driven by the firm. It is suggested that this approach forms a robust design in that it allows the firm to deal with the uncertainty by simultaneously developing its products and exploring markets, while preserving the flexibility to adapt to the changing environment. Practical implications - The practical implication of this paper is to suggest an alternative approach to deliberate planning in high-tech ventures. With this approach, rather than markets and products, strategy defines a market and technology exploration process. Originality/value - The paper is original in three ways. It links the product design and market exploration processes in high-tech firm development; it is based on an in-depth longitudinal study; and it results from an academic-practitioner collaborative work. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","New products; Product development; Uncertainty management","Decision making; Marketing; Product design; Strategic planning; Uncertain systems; Entrepreneurship; New products development; Technology exploration; Uncertainty management; Product development","Battelle, J., (2005) The Search - How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture, , Portfolio New York, NY; Berthon, P., Hulbert, J.M., Pitt, L.F., To serve or to create: Strategic orientations towards customers and innovation (1999) California Management Review, 42 (1), pp. 37-58; Bhide, A., How entrepreneurs craft strategies that work (1994) Harvard Business Review, pp. 150-61. , March-April; Brown, S.L., Eisenhardt, K.M., Product development: Past research, present findings, and future directions (1995) Academy of Management Review, 20 (2), pp. 343-78; Collis, D.J., Research note: How valuable are organizational capabilities?

The study applies a longitudinal process research approach to investigate strategic decision making in new venture creation over time. Combining qualitative and quantitative methods, we analyze 385 decision events across nine technology-based ventures. Our observations suggest a hybrid perspective on strategic decision making, demonstrating how effectuation and causation logics are combined and how entrepreneurs' emphasis on these logics shifts and re-shifts over time.

We find that entrepreneurial self-efficacy facilitates development of formal business plans and entrepreneurial perseverance promotes engaging in business planning activities. Further, advanced academic education leads nascent entrepreneurs to engage in business planning activities and create formal business plans, but prior work experience has a marginal effect on business plan formality. The results further indicate that a nascent entrepreneur's striving for outside financing promotes business planning activities, while being in a supportive environment or a member of a business association does not impact business planning behavior. © 2015 Strategic Management Society.","Business planning; Cognitive characteristics; Human capital; Institutional forces; Nascent entrepreneurs",,"Alvarez, S.A., Barney, J.B., How do entrepreneurs organize firms under conditions of uncertainty?

We argue that these two approaches are generic decision-making mechanisms that can coexist with one another and that they are configured in specific ways during different phases in the process of new product creation. These decision-making mechanisms are influenced by internal and external market factors: the nature of activities of a phase and the interplay between the business model and tactics. Our research framework is a generic two-stage competitive process that separates business models from tactics. We conducted an in-depth case study of a console game creation project to examine these decision-making mechanisms and to explore how business models are formulated and how each mechanism influences subsequent tactics during the new product creation process. Our findings suggest the following four decision-making configurations with unique modes of interplay between business models and tactics: effectuation centric, discovery centric, causation centric, and tactic centric. The theoretical insights on the linkage between decision-making mechanisms and business models have important practical implications for new product creation. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Business model; causation; effectuation; new product development processes; organizational decision-making processes; tactics","Electrical engineering; Engineering; Business modeling; causation; effectuation; New product development process; Organizational decision making; tactics; Decision making","Morris, M., Schindehutte, M., Allen, J., The entrepreneur's business model: Toward a unified perspective (2005) Journal of Business Research, 58 (6), pp. 726-735. , DOI 10.1016/j.jbusres.2003.11.001, PII S014829630300242X, The Nonprofit Marketing Landscape; Magretta, J., Why business models matter a conversation with robertredford (2002) Harvard Bus.

Yet, unlike experts, novice entrepreneurs still tend to rely on predictions and forecasts as they move their ideas through t h e venture creation process. This study examines the role of entrepreneurial self-efficacy (ESE) and situational framing in mitigating t h e seemingly negative consequences of an ""experience deficit"" and promoting the use of effectuation - a non-predictive logic associated with entrepreneurial expertise. The results of a randomized experiment show that, in contrast to a control group and a l ow ESE group, novices who experienced an increase in ESE were more likely to use effectuation under uncertainty. This relationship was mediated by the framing of the situation as an opportunity. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Effectuation; Entrepreneurial self-efficacy; Experiment; Opportunity; Uncertainty",,"Alvarez, S.A., Barney, J.B., Discovery and creation: alternative theories of entrepreneurial action (2007) Strateg.

It carefully aims to re-examine the notion of environmental uncertainty, the main theoretical approaches advanced by literature on strategy to cope with uncertainty, and foresight activities in corporate organizations. Design/methodology/approach: This article is theoretical in nature. However, its insights are significantly based on empirical analysis: the author has been involved in the past ten years in in-depth investigation of foresight practices in several international firms of different industries. Findings: Several important issues and research questions on strategic foresight have remained largely unresolved from both an academic and managerial perspective. This paper outlines such questions. Originality/value: The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it links the work on strategic foresight to a wide range of related literature streams, thus revealing new connections and issues to be explored. Second, it develops a research agenda that may inspire further theoretical and empirical work on the nature and effects of strategic foresight efforts. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Environmental uncertainty; Forward planning; Learning; Planning; Strategic foresight; Strategic management; Uncertainty management",,"Alsan, A., Oner, M.A., An integrated view of foresight: Integrated foresight management model (2003) Foresight, 5 (2), pp. 33-45; Amram, M., Kulatilaka, N., (1999) Real Options: Managing Strategic Investment in an Uncertain World, , Harvard Business School Press, Boston, MA; Ansoff, H.I., Critique of Henry Mintzberg's 'The design school': Reconsidering the basic premises of strategic management (1991) Strategic Management Journal, 12 (6), pp. 449-461; Becker, P., (2002) Corporate Foresight in Europe: A First Overview, RTK2 Scientific and Technological Foresight, , European Commission, Brussels; Bradfield, R., Wright, G., Burt, G., Cairns, G., van der Heijden, K., The origins and evolution of scenario techniques in long range business planning (2005) Futures, 37 (8), pp. 795-812; Bradley MacKay, R., Costanzo, L.A., Introduction (2009) Handbook of Research on Strategic Foresight, pp. 1-12. , Bradley MacKay, R., Costanzo, L.A.

This article integrates recent developments from entrepreneurship and innovation research streams to better understand the conditions and causal mechanisms that influence disruptive innovation. Drawing on effectuation, evolutionary entrepreneurship, lead-users, collective intelligence and opportunity tournament literature, a theoretical framework is developed that explains disruptive innovation as a coevolutionary entrepreneurial process at the firm, product, and customer level. The framework offers a set of testable propositions to advance theory and practice in the field.

Sarasvathy and appealing to scholarly work in various fields of interest. Two groups of capabilities are distinguished: individuals' anchored capabilities and context related capabilities. Identity and knowledge are presented as distinct capability components of the first group; networks, legitimacy and localness as the components of the second group. The presentation aims at bringing out the vision of a dynamic contextual set of interdependent distinct capabilities that underpin the entrepreneur's proactivity. It also suggests new ways to approach the challenging issue of sustainable entrepreneurship. © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Effectual entrepreneur; Entrepreneurial capabilities; Identity; Knowledge; Legitimacy; Localness; Networks; Resource development view; Sustainable entrepreneurship",,"Aldrich, H., Fiol, C., Fools rush in? the institutional context of industry creation (1994) Academy of Management Review, 19, pp. 645-670; Aldrich, H., Zimmer, C., Entrepreneurship through social networks (1986) The Art and Science of Entrepreneurship, pp. 3-23. , Sexton, D. and Smilor, R.

Informed by the microfoundation movement in strategic management, actor engagement is conceptualized as a microfoundation for value co-creation within the context of a service ecosystem. Using a trans-disciplinary perspective, actors are viewed not only as humans, but also as machines and various combinations of humans and machines. Actor engagement is defined as both the actor's disposition to engage, and the activity of engaging in an interactive process of resource integration within a service ecosystem. This leads to identifying research issues for actors, engagement platforms, actor disposition, engagement properties and resource integration patterns. We conclude by drawing implications based on the identified research issues. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Actor engagement; Co-creation of value; Micro-foundation; Service ecosystems",,"Alexander, C., Ishikawa, S., Silverstein, M., Jacobson, M., Fiksdahl-King, I., Angel, S., (1977) A pattern language, , Oxford University Press, New York, NY; Arthur, W.B., (2009) The nature of technology: What it is and how it evolves, , Free Press, New York, NY; Arthur, W.B., (2014) Complexity and the economy, , Oxford University Press, New York, NY; Barney, J., Felin, T., What are microfoundations?

We also suggest that commitment and ambition (or “high potential”) moderate these responses. Our most important finding is the relative absence of behavioral crisis responses. However, crises may make high-tech founders become more likely to disengage, whereas the opposite holds for founders far into the process. Our study sheds light on the mechanisms behind aggregate effects of crises on the number and type of start-ups in an economy, and can guide future research on the effect of crises on nascent entrepreneurship. © 2015 Baylor University",,,"Aldrich, H.E., Auster, E.R., Even dwarfs started small: Liabilities of age and size and their strategic implications (1986) Research in organizational behavior, 8, pp. 165-198. , &, In, B.M.

Although research often conceptualizes these concepts as interrelated, precisely how they relate to and complement one another and where they diverge remains unclear. This article examines the roots of each of these concepts and their underlying assumptions, organizing them within a unifying conceptual frame. Our analysis reveals a set of entailing implications that can guide future conceptual and empirical work in entrepreneurship, and it advances our understanding of value creation and capture in strategy, organization theory, management, and related fields. Managerial summary: What are entrepreneurs doing? At the highest level of abstraction, entrepreneurs are identifying and exploiting opportunities. Recently, several lines of research have examined how certain types of entrepreneurial action can result in forming, rather than merely encountering, opportunities. Scholars engaged in this work have used both deductive and observational approaches, which have been rarely examined jointly or integrated into a comprehensive framework. This article focuses on the literature on opportunity creation, effectuation, and bricolage, examining each of the approaches and their underlying assumptions, and it organizes them within a unifying conceptual frame. Doing so reveals avenues for future work, in particular the development of new theories of opportunity formation, and implications for research in related fields such as strategic management, organization theory, and economics. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Boundary conditions; Bricolage; Creation; Effectuation; Opportunities",,"Aldrich, H.E., Kenworthy, A., The accidental entrepreneur: Campbellian antinomies and organizational foundings (1999) Variations in Organization Science: In Honor of Donald T.

Results from a national (USA) random sample of founding CEOs (n = 223) found entrepreneurial experience (an aspect of human capital) to be positively related to performance in discovery contexts, whereas educational attainment, strong ties, and psychological capital (a composite index of optimism, self-efficacy, resilience, and hope) were positively related to performance in creation contexts. These findings extend theorizing concerning discovery and creation perspectives from the pre-entry phase (opportunity recognition) to the post-entry phase (opportunity exploitation) of the entrepreneurial process. Managerial summary: This research investigates the relationships of founding CEOs' intangible resources with the performance of their firms in industry environments that are stable (slow changing and predictable) versus dynamic (fast changing and unpredictable). The results indicate that entrepreneurial experience (number of prior new ventures founded) is positively related to performance in stable environments, whereas educational attainment (highest educational degree earned), strong ties (social connections to family members and friends who provide support relating to the firm), and psychological capital (inner cognitive, emotional, and behavioral resources used to cope with adversity) are positively related to performance in dynamic environments. The findings highlight the importance of fit between the intangible resources of founding CEOs and the characteristics of the industries in which they attempt to develop and grow their firms.

First, the ubiquity of non-proprietary online trading platforms encourages the adoption of effectual approaches and removes the importance of forming proprietary strategic alliances and pre-commitments. Second, the notion of affordable loss – a central tenet of effectuation – should be extended beyond the notion of economic to social affordable loss, including loss of status and reputation, and finally, home-based online businesses allow effectuation to be associated with low levels of entrepreneurial self-efficacy and experience. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.","effectuation; home-based; online-entrepreneur; theory-refinement",,"Aldrich, H., Zimmer, C., Entrepreneurship through social networks (1986) The Art and Science of Entrepreneurship, pp. 3-23. , Sexton D., Smilor R., (eds), New York: Ballinger,,.

It integrates effectuation theory with the revisited Uppsala internationalization process model to understand the unintentional aspect of networking by internationalizing SMEs. The research design is a multiple-case study approach. The findings show how entrepreneurs network with interested partners, instead of carefully selecting international partners according to predefined network goals. Entrepreneurs who network effectually enter markets wherever an opportunity emerges, and commit to network relations that increase their means. Network relations become an integrating point for effectuation theory from entrepreneurship research and the revised Uppsala model from international business. This bridge between the two areas suggests some implications for network research in International Entrepreneurship. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Effectuation; International entrepreneurship; International SMEs; Internationalization; Networks",,"Agndal, H., Chetty, S., The impact of relationships on changes in internationalization strategies of SMEs (2007) European Journal of Marketing, 41 (11-12), pp. 1449-1474; Andersson, S., International entrepreneurship, born globals and the theory of effectuation (2011) Journal of Small Business and Enterprise Development, 18 (3), pp. 627-643; Axelsson, B., Johanson, J., Foreign market entry: the textbook vs. the network view (1992) Industrial networks: a new view of reality, pp. 218-234. , Axelsson B, Easton G, (eds), Routledge, Londo; Bello, D.C., Kostova, T., From the editors: conducting high impact international business research: the role of theory (2012) Journal of International Business Studies, 43 (6), pp. 537-543; Bhowmick, S.

Design/methodology/approach-This paper is based on a multiple case study of major firms of the energy and the mobile communication industries. Findings-The focus is on strategic foresight and organizational flexibility: the author introduces the concept of “boundary uncertainty” and investigates its managerial implications. Originality/value-The main contribution of this paper is to expand our understanding of environmental uncertainty and to reinvigorate the study of strategic decision making in turbulent industries. The author provides descriptive data on the foresight approaches that some of the world’s largest and most influential companies used throughout the 2000s for remaining aligned with their fast-paced environments, and thus informs the debate between the “planning” and the “learning” schools of strategic management. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Environmental uncertainty; Flexibility; Strategic decision making; Strategic foresight; Strategic management; Uncertainty management; Volatility",,"Adner, R., When are technologies disruptive?

Design/methodology/approach – To further the understanding of opportunity types, the paper employs Dubin’s (1978) theory building methodology focussing specifically on the concepts of system states. Approaching opportunity types as system states clarifies the relationship between discovery and creation opportunities. Findings – This research argues that opportunities transition from creation opportunities to discovery opportunities. Furthermore, understanding the opportunity state can clarify the practical implications for entrepreneurs. In particular, entrepreneurs in discovery states employ different processes regarding human resources, strategy, financing, planning, leadership, and potential competitive advantage than entrepreneurs pursuing creation states. Originality/value – This paper offers value to researchers by clarifying the differences between opportunity types. To date, there has been little to no investigation into how opportunity types change from one type to another. This research offers to clarify the debate about the existence of different opportunity types and move the discussion forward theoretically. Additionally, this manuscript offers practical insights for entrepreneurs pursuing different types of opportunities. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Creation; Discovery; Entrepreneurship; Opportunities; Theory building",,"Alvarez, S.A., Barney, J.B., Discovery and creation: Alternative theories of entrepreneurial action (2007) Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal, 1 (1-2), pp. 11-26; Alvarez, S.A., Barney, J.B., Entrepreneurship and epistemology: The philosophical underpinnings of the study of entrepreneurial opportunities (2010) The Academy of Management Annals, 4, pp. 557-583; Alvarez, S.A., Barney, J.B., Epistemology, opportunities, and entrepreneurship: Comments on Venkataraman et al.

We advance research on opportunity evaluation by investigating how people may diverge in their views of what defines an attractive business opportunity; that is, we seek to understand heterogeneity among individuals' 'opportunity templates.' Using unique data from a conjoint experiment with 141 respondents (6,728 opportunity evaluations), our analysis reveals significant differences in the opportunity preferences of individuals with technological, management, and entrepreneurship experience. We also find that people with specialist experience (technology) emphasize fewer opportunity dimensions than people with generalist experience (management, entrepreneurship). © 2015 Strategic Management Society.","Conjoint analysis; Experience; Heterogeneity; Knowledge; Opportunity evaluation",,"Adelson, B., Problem solving and the development of abstract categories in programming languages (1981) Memory and Cognition, 9, pp. 422-433; Alvarez, S.A., Barney, J.B., Discovery and creation: alternative theories of entrepreneurial action (2007) Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal, 1 (1-2), pp. 11-26; Alvarez, S.A., Barney, J.B., Anderson, P., Forming and exploiting opportunities: the implications of discovery and creation processes for entrepreneurial and organizational research (2013) Organization Science, 24, pp. 301-317; Alvarez, S.A., Busenitz, L.W., The entrepreneurship of resource-based theory (2001) Journal of Management, 27, pp. 755-776; Bailyn, L., Lynch, J.T., Engineering as a life-long career: its meaning, its satisfactions, its difficulties (1983) Journal of Occupational Behaviour, 4, pp. 263-283; Baker, T., Aldag, R., Blair, E., Gender and entrepreneurial opportunity evaluation (2003) Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Research, pp. 689-702. , In, Bygrave WD (ed).

As such, this paper aims first to build on the extant literature on organizational, project and Market Vision in order to construct a measure for Technology Vision through theory construction, scale development and modeling. The second goal is to help firms to better understand what the underlying components of Technology Vision are in order to offer themselves the best possible chance of success with the development of radically new, high-tech products. Based on samples of firms involved with radical innovation research and development in high-tech sectors in North America and the United Kingdom, conceptual and measurement studies conducted herewith suggest there are five factors related to Technology Vision: Technology Vision benefits, Technology Vision efficiency, Technology Vision magnetism, Technology Vision specificity, and infrastructure clarity. The paper concludes with an examination of the implications of these components of Technology Vision and discusses the need to understand its relationship with Market Vision and the performance of the firm. © 2011 The Authors.

Prediction-based strategies focus on estimating unknowns via sampling methods, whereas control-based strategies focus on shaping unknowns via proactive behavior. These strategies may lead to different propensities to undertake uncertain prospects, as they differ in terms of cognition and involvement. In an experimental test, we study the conditions under which prediction- and control-based strategies lead subjects to accept bets in ambiguous environments. Individuals who use control methods to mitigate uncertainty are more likely to accept the bet after a favorable outcome compared to those who use predictive methods. These results revert in the presence of unfavorable outcomes. We discuss the implications for entrepreneurship theory and practice. Managerial summary: Entrepreneurs often adopt prediction- and control-based strategies in order to reduce uncertainty. Prediction-based strategies focus on gathering information to estimate future outcomes, whereas control-based strategies concentrate on taking actions to create a more favorable environment for the venture. Results from an experimental test show that these strategies can affect behavior differently. In particular, when the decision maker receives favorable information, control-based strategies are more likely to lead to the acceptance of an uncertain prospect than prediction-based strategies. This effect reverts when the decision maker receives unfavorable information. Our findings are valuable for entrepreneurs, investors, and policy makers. Understanding the distinctive impact of strategy on behavior may help entrepreneurs and investors calibrate the potential of a venture, thereby avoiding the misallocation of valuable resources. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Effectuation; Entrepreneurship; Experimental economics; Theories of entrepreneurship; Uncertainty",,"Acs, Z., Audretsch, D., Desai, S., Welpe, I., On experiments in entrepreneurship research (2010) Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization, 76 (1), pp. 1-2; Alvarez, S., Barney, J.B., How do entrepreneurs organize firms under conditions of uncertainty?

More generally, we investigate the value that firms, facing growing uncertainty because of the fast pace of external changes, create through foresight. We base our analysis on three different research streams: the first one is literature on environmental uncertainty; the second one is literature on strategic planning and first mover (dis)advantages; and the third one is literature on organizational learning and organizational memories. We thus focus on two fundamental questions which characterize the interaction between turbulent environments, foresight and long-term performances: what kind of knowledge should organizations achieve in order to sustain their competitive edge?

A variety of foresight tools are in place to support top management's strategic decision-making. However, leaders cannot claim to have the full scope of knowledge and capabilities required for creating a long-term, robust and implementable strategy. Today, many experts with the relevant detailed knowledge about future developments and organisational capabilities can be found in middle management, which needs to be reflected in an integrative approach towards strategy development.In this paper, an approach is presented that describes how a foresight-based strategy development approach can be designed in order to leverage the potential of middle management. This approach is applied in strategy development to the supply chain management of a multinational manufacturing company. The case focuses on Asia, and includes 37 middle managers plus their staff - totalling approximately 70 employees - from 13 countries. The results indicate that top and middle management were willing to follow the highly structured process, contributing to strategy development in terms of ideas, data, time, resources and analytical work. The developed strategy integrated the middle management's perspective successfully and strategy implementation started immediately. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Corporate foresight; Middle management; Scenarios; Strategy development; Strategy-as-practice","Human resource management; Information management; Knowledge management; Planning; Supply chain management; Corporate foresight; Middle management; Scenarios; Strategy as practices; Strategy development; Decision making","Hutzschenreuther, T., Kleindienst, I., Strategy-process research: what have we learned and what is still to be explored (2006) J.

Path dependence theory can be ascribed to both contingent and deterministic views of change, whereas path breaking and path creation stress the voluntaristic influences actors have on changing and shaping paths. By contrasting these theories, and based on the idea of restrictive indeterminism, a midway approach called planned path emergence is suggested as a realistic view.","Path breaking; Path creation; Path dependence; Restrictive indeterminism; Theory of change; Theory of future genesis",,"Amara, R., The futures field: Searching for definitions and boundaries (1981) Futurist, 15 (1), pp. 25-29; Arthur, W.B., Self-reinforcing mechanisms in economics (1988) The Economy as an Evolving Complex System.

However, rural entrepreneurs face barriers and challenges throughout the start-up and growth stages of their ventures. The rapid development of e-commerce, coupled with increasing big-box competition and shifting demographics challenge the sustainability of rural SMEs. The literature recognizes gaps in SME owner capability, pertaining to business planning, the use of financial information, the implementation of Information Technologies, and funding. It should be noted that the effectiveness of Government policies regarding support for training in these areas through publically funded agencies is well documented. However, research regarding the effectiveness of these agencies in reaching and meeting the needs of rural venture owners is primarily restricted to funding requirements. This paper examines the utilization and satisfaction of venture support agencies and community organizations by rural SME owners in 14 communities through a Business Expansion and Retention (BR&E) research project conducted in Alberta, Canada. The results indicated that agency usage can be effectively predicted by firm size, degree of localization, and planning. Results indicate that while many owners identified the need for assistance in training and funding, the utilization of support agencies, underscored by the lack of user satisfaction, may hinder rather than enhance venture viability and growth. The implications for government policy are discussed in the context of enhancing the effectiveness of support agencies, thereby contributing to the viability of ventures and the sustainability of rural communities.","Rural SMEs; Small business; Support agencies",,"Arikan, A., Regional entrepreneurial transformation: A complex systems perspective (2010) Journal of Small Business Management, 48 (2), pp. 152-173; Audet, J., St-Jean, E., Factors affecting the use of public support services by SME owners: Evidence from a periphery of Canada (2007) Journal of Developmental Entrepreneurship, 12 (2), pp. 165-180; Bennett, R.J., Robson, P.J.A., The use of external business advice by SMEs in Britain (1999) Entrepreneurship and Regional Development, 11, pp. 155-180; Besser, T.L., Recker, N., Parker, M., The impact of new employers from the outside, the growth of local capitalism, and new amenities on the social and economic welfare of small towns (2009) Economic Development Quarterly, 23 (4), pp. 306-316; Birch, D., (1987) Job Creation in America, , New York, NY: Free Press/MacMillan Publishing Company; Boothroyd, P., Davis, H.C., Community economic development: Three approaches (1993) Journal of Planning Education and Research, 12, pp. 230-240; Brinkmann, J., Grichnik, D., Kapsa, D., Should entrepreneurs plan or just storm the castle?

Building on the typology of entrepreneurial identities developed by Fauchart and Gruber, this study examines the relationship between the social identity of the entrepreneur and subsequent entrepreneurial behaviour using a mixed-method approach. Based on interviews with entrepreneurs in six start-ups within the tourism sector and on previous literature, three hypotheses were developed regarding the relationship between entrepreneurial identity and entrepreneurial behaviour (causation, effectuation). Subsequently, the hypotheses were tested using a survey among a sample of entrepreneurs who registered a new firm in 2013. The study finds that the entrepreneurial identity influences whether the individual predominantly engages in effectual or causal behaviour. Hence, the study contributes by focusing on entrepreneurial identity as an important factor shaping the behaviours of entrepreneurs. In addition, we add to the understanding of entrepreneurs as a heterogeneous group. Entrepreneurs vary in terms of their identity, and this variation has consequences for their entrepreneurial behaviour. Finally, by adopting a mixed-method approach, this study benefits from and contributes to the interaction of qualitative and quantitative data in entrepreneurship research. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","causation; effectuation; entrepreneurial behaviour; Entrepreneurial identity; social identity theory",,"Alsos, G.A., Clausen, T.H., The Start-up Processes of Tourism Firms - the Use of Causation and Effectuation Strategies (2014) Handbook of Research on Innovation in Tourism, pp. 181-202. , Alsos G.A., Eide D., Madsen E.L., (eds), Cheltenham: Edward Elgar; Alsos, G.A., Clausen, T.H., Solvoll, S., (2014) Paper presented at Academy of Management Meeting, , Philadelphia, PA:; Alsos, G.A., Eide, D., Madsen, E.L., Introduction: Innovation in Tourism Industries (2014) Handbook of Research on Innovation in Tourism Industries, pp. 1-26. , Alsos G.A., Eide D., Madsen E.L., (eds), Cheltenham: Edward Elgar; Ashforth, B.E., Harrison, S.H., Corley, K.G., Identification in Organizations: An Examination of Four Fundamental Questions (2008) Journal of Management, 34 (3), pp. 325-374; Ateljevic, I., Doorne, S., ‘Staying within the Fence’: Lifestyle Entrepreneurship in Tourism (2000) Journal of Sustainable Tourism, 8 (5), pp. 378-392; Bacq, S., Janssen, F., The Multiple Faces of Social Entrepreneurship: A Review of Definitional Issues Based on Geographical and Thematic Criteria (2011) Entrepreneurship & Regional Development, 23 (5-6), pp. 373-403; Brown, R., Social Identity Theory: Past Achievements, Current Problems and Future Challenges (2000) European Journal of Social Psychology, 30 (6), pp. 745-778; Burke, P.J., Reitzes, D.C., The Link between Identity and Role Performance (1981) Social Psychology Quarterly, 44 (2), pp. 83-92; Cardon, M.S., Sudek, R., Mitteness, C., The Impact of Perceived Entrepreneurial Passion on Angel Investing (2009) Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Research, 29 (2). , http://digitalknowledge.babson.edu/fer/vol29/iss2/1; Chandler, G.N., DeTienne, D.R., McKelvie, A., Mumford, T.V., Causation and Effectuation Processes: A Validation Study (2011) Journal of Business Venturing, 26 (3), pp. 375-390; Chasserio, S., Pailot, P., Poroli, C., When Entrepreneurial Identity Meets Multiple Social Identities: Interplays and Identity Work of Women Entrepreneurs (2014) International Journal of Entrepreneurial Behaviour & Research, 20 (2), pp. 128-154; Coupland, C., Brown, A.D., Identities in Action: Processes and Outcomes (2012) Scandinavian Journal of Management, 28 (1), pp. 1-4; Davidsson, P., The Domain of Entrepreneurship Research: Some Suggestions (2003) Cognitive Approaches to Entrepreneurship Research, pp. 315-372. , Katz J.A., Shepherd D.A., (eds), Oxford: Elsevier Science; Davidsson, P., (2008) The Entrepreneurship Research Challenge, , Cheltenham: Edward Elgar; Davidsson, P., Honig, B., The Role of Social and Human Capital among Nascent Entrepreneurs (2003) Journal of Business Venturing, 18 (3), pp. 301-331; Dew, N., Read, S., Sarasvathy, S.D., Wiltbank, R., Effectual versus Predictive Logics in Entrepreneurial Decision-Making: Differences between Experts and Novices (2009) Journal of Business Venturing, 24 (4), pp. 287-309; Dew, N., Sarasvathy, S., Innovations, Stakeholders & Entrepreneurship (2007) Journal of Business Ethics, 74 (3), pp. 267-283; Dew, N., Sarasvathy, S.D., Read, S., Wiltbank, R., Affordable Loss: Behavioral Economic Aspects of the Plunge Decision (2009) Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal, 3 (2), pp. 105-126; Di Domenico, M., Miller, G., Farming and Tourism Enterprise: Experiential Authenticity in the Diversification of Independent Small-Scale Family Farming (2012) Tourism Management, 33 (2), pp. 285-294; Down, S., (2006) Narratives of Enterprise, , Cheltenham: Edward Elgar; Down, S., Warren, L., Constructing Narratives of Enterprise: Clichés and Entrepreneurial Self-Identity (2008) International Journal of Entrepreneurial Behaviour & Research, 14 (1), pp. 4-23; Erzberger, C., Prein, G., Triangulation: Validity and Empirically-Based Hypothesis Construction (1997) Quality & Quantity, 31 (2), pp. 141-154; Essers, C., Benschop, Y., Enterprising Identities: Female Entrepreneurs of Moroccan or Turkish Origin in the Netherlands (2007) Organization Studies, 28 (1), pp. 49-69; Essers, C., Benschop, Y., Muslim Businesswomen Doing Boundary Work: The Negotiation of Islam, Gender and Ethnicity within Entrepreneurial Contexts (2009) Human Relations, 62 (3), pp. 403-423; Falck, O., Heblich, S., Luedemann, E., Identity and Entrepreneurship: Do School Peers Shape Entrepreneurial Intentions?

Such deviation has primarily been described as singular events where individuals with prior knowledge discover a new opportunity. In this article, we will instead study deviation as a process of collective decision making, seen more as something mindful than singular. The purpose is to explore mindful deviation as decision making by nascent technology entrepreneurs as they conceptualize an early platform technology. Based on case assignments undertaken by 13 teams in a venture creation programme, C-K design theory is used to trace how nascent technology entrepreneurs in action combine causal and effectual decision-making logics. Individually answered questionnaires also offered insights into how the entrepreneurs perceived their decision making in hindsight. The findings break with our received wisdom around how opportunities are recognized as well as how effectual and causal logics occur. As a result, mindful deviation through combinations of effectual and causal logic is suggested as a means to understand early-stage technology entrepreneurship. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,"Agogué, M., Hooge, S., Arnoux, F., Brown, I., (2014) Introduction to C-K Theory, , Presses des Mines, Paris; Agogué, M., Kazakçi, A., 10 Years of C-K Theory: A Survey on the Academic and Industrial Impacts of a Design Theory (2014) An Anthology of Theories and Models of Design, pp. 219-236. , In Chakrabarti, A. and Blessing, L.T.

We conjecture and find that, in contrast to other environments where there is less uncertainty, reverse stock splits in the biotechnology industry are followed by positive abnormal returns over the subsequent 1- to 12-months. Also consistent with our effectuation-based predictions, we find that these returns are positively related to the reverse split ratio, size, cash holding, and longterm debt, and negatively related to the market-to-book ratio and firm age. We also find that liquidity improves after a reverse stock split. These results suggest that the concept of effectuation theory is better suited to analyzing reverse stock splits in the biotechnology industry.","Biotechnology; Cumulative abnormal returns (CARs); Effectuation; Event study; Liquidity; Reverse stock splits","Innovation; Cumulative abnormal returns; Effectuation; Event studies; Liquidity; Stock splits; Biotechnology; Article; biotechnological production; commercial phenomena; conceptual framework; cross-sectional study; economic aspect; environmental impact; explanatory variable; financial management; human; methodology; patent; prediction; product development; social marketing; statistical concepts; time series analysis","Wiltbank, R., Read, S., Dew, N., Sarasvathy, S.D., Prediction and control under uncertainty: Outcomes in angel investing (2009) Journal of Business Venturing, 24 (2), pp. 116-133; Wierenga, D.E., Eaton, C.R., (2006) Drug Development and Approval Process (USA): Office of Research and Development-pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, , http://ageconsearch.umn.edu, accessed on December 7, 2013; Ahn, M.J., Couch, R.B., Wu, W., Financing development stage biotechnology companies: RMs vs. IPOs (2008) Journal of Health Care Finance, 38 (1), p. 32; Black, B.S., Gilson, R.J., Venture capital and the structure of capital markets: Banks versus stock markets (1998) Journal of Financial Economics, 47 (3), pp. 243-277; Allen, F., Gale, D., Diversity of opinion and financing of new technologies (1999) Journal of Financial Intermediation, 8 (1), pp. 68-89; Newton, D.P., Paxson, D.A., Widdicks, M., Real R&D options (2004) International Journal of Management Reviews, 5 (2), pp. 113-130; Wiltbank, R., Dew, N., Read, S., Sarasvathy, S.D., What to do next?

In this article, we draw on a qualitative case study of a leading European airline and examine the resource bundles used by managers in their orchestration of ambidexterity. Adopting a resource-advantage perspective, the study illustrates elements of human, organisational, and informational capital that are mobilised by managers in their incorporation of alignment-oriented and adaptability-oriented activities. By moving beyond a linear association between strategic resources and ambidextrous organisations, we argue that managers' orchestration of ambidexterity is central to how service organisations manage their strategic resources and enhance competitiveness. Overall, we highlight the micro managerial level as an important point of observation to extend current thinking on the ‘how’ of ambidexterity in service organisations. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","ambidexterity; case study; resource-advantage theory; strategic capital","adaptive management; air transportation; competitiveness; industrial performance; service sector; strategic approach; Europe","Adler, P.S., Goldoftas, B., Levine, D.I., Flexibility versus efficiency?

This article empirically investigates the influence of effectuation on entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and firm performance, while considering environmental uncertainty as a moderating influence. A survey is administered to a sample of high-technology firms and hypotheses are tested using correlational and regression analysis. A positive relationship between effectuation and the firm's level of EO is established, where this effectuation moderates the relationship between EO and firm performance. However, the interaction effect between effectuation and environmental dynamism and hostility proves to be non-significant. By applying an empirical lens this study increases the relevance and generalisability of effectuation theory by expanding it from mostly a descriptive nature to a theory that accounts for moderators in the EO-performance relationship. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","effectuation; entrepreneurial orientation; environmental hostility and dynamism; innovative performance; technology; uncertainty","entrepreneur; high technology industry; industrial performance; innovation; strategic approach; technological change; technological development; entrepreneur; high technology industry; industrial performance; innovation; uncertainty analysis","Alegre, J., Pla-Barber, J., Chiva, R., Villar, C., Organisational learning capability, product innovation performance and export intensity (2012) Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, 24, pp. 511-526; Allen, K., Stearns, T., Technology entrepreneurs (2004) Handbook of entrepreneurial dynamics: The process of business creation, pp. 438-447. , In: Gartner W.B., Shaver K.G., Carter N.M., Reynolds P.D., editors Thousand Oaks, CA, Thousand Oaks, CA,: Sage Publications; Anderson, B.S., Covin, J.G., Slevin, D.P., Understanding the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and strategic learning capability: An empirical investigation (2009) Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal, 3, pp. 218-240; Baker, W.E., Sinkula, J.M., Learning orientation, market orientation, and innovation: Integrating and extending models of organizational performance (1999) Journal of Market Focused Management, 4, pp. 295-308; Blanco, S., How techno-entrepreneurs build a potentially exciting future?

This paper aims to contribute to the design management literature by introducing entrepreneurship as an alternative management perspective. Entrepreneurship holds the capacity to add new valuable managerial meaning to the term design management that does not disrupt the uniqueness of design. A differentiation is made between two logics of management – administrative management and entrepreneurial management – and the article argues against a one-management-style-fits-alldesign- processes approach. Design associated with complex and wicked problems may be more closely associated with entrepreneurial design management, whereas design based on simpler and tamer design problems may align better with administrative design management.

Project SD strategy is the missing link between SD at the corporate level and project level. The framework draws on a literature review of concepts, definitions, and theories in strategic management, corporate sustainability, and projects. The conceptual framework presented in this book chapter has six key components. These are: (1) corporate sustainability strategy; (2) project understanding of SD and SD business case; (3) strategizing at project initiation stage; (4) project autonomy to negotiate and adapt in the project context; (5) project capability to translate corporate SD strategy to project SD strategy; and (6) project capability in stakeholder management. The premise of the framework is the compatibility of the socially constructed realities of the project and SD, as indicated in SD and project literature. The aim is to help develop new knowledge and insight into how business can integrate SD principles into core business operations such as projects from a process perspective, rather than sustainability content perspective. This chapter is based on doctoral dissertation research by the lead author. © 2013 by IGI Global.

One of the major issues in applying entrepreneurship and innovation to corporations is likely the misunderstanding and failed application of these core concepts to management practices. Thus, those studying intrapreneurship and innovation would find great value from this paper's discussion of effectuation and effectual logic as it explains its major differences between entrepreneurs and typical enterprise manager views as they pertain to: Goal setting, risk taking, resource selection and gathering, dealing with setbacks, building networks, and management control. To dive deeper into these valuable concepts, effectuation and its core principles were applied to the product development process and systems development process. This includes applying them to: Screening of ideas, business analysis, development, product validation, and the market launches phase of product development. This article should help those applying entrepreneurship practices to their organizations and result in more innovative managers and employees, or as the authors term it ""enterprise entrepreneurs.",,"Business analysis; Goal setting; Intrapreneurships; Management control; Management practices; Market launch; Product development process; Product validation; Resource selection; Risk taking; Systems development process; Industry; Managers; Product development; Risk management; Human resource management","Sarasvathy, S.D., Effectual reasoning in entrepreneurial decision making: Existence and bounds (2001) Academy of Management Proceedings, pp. D1-D6; Mitchell, R.K., Busenitz, L., Lant, T., McDougall, P.P., Morse, E.A., Smith, J.B., Toward a theory of entrepreneurial cognition: Rethinking the people side of entrepreneurship research (2002) Entrepreneurship: Theory & Practice, 27 (2), pp. 93-104; Wiltbank, R., Dew, N., Read, S., Sarasvathy, S.D., What to do next?

We analyze the relations between R&D intensity (R&D spending to sales) and R&D spending on the one hand and 11 different indicators of firm risk on the other, using data from 1,907 to 3,908 firms in various industries over 13 years. The analysis finds a general lack of consistent positive association between R&D and firm risk, making the use of R&D as an indicator of risk taking questionable. Furthermore, R&D intensity and spending do not correlate positively, suggesting they measure different constructs. We discuss potential reasons for these nonsignificant results. Our study demonstrates that researchers should avoid casual use of R&D as a proxy for risk taking without explicitly providing a clear definition and measurement model for risk. Managerial summary: Risk is a key construct in strategic management research. Many studies in this area measure risk taking by research and development (R&D) intensity (the ratio of R&D spending to sales) or R&D spending. However, since R&D intensity and spending have also been used to measure various other things such as information processing demands, this raises the question of whether R&D intensity and spending are valid indicators of firm risk. We examine this issue by considering the associations of R&D intensity and R&D spending with conventional measures of firm risk. We find a general lack of consistent positive association between R&D and firm risk, making the use of R&D as an indicator of risk taking questionable. Furthermore, R&D intensity and spending do not correlate positively, suggesting they measure different things. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper presents a review of 622 articles on organizational planning approaches for achieving a sustainable future, and organizes this literature into a taxonomy of four planning approaches (predictive, adaptive, visionary, and transformational planning) and their associated planning tools or methodologies. While the most prominent theme among the reviewed literature is that transformational change is necessary to address the sustainability challenges of the future, this review identifies a lack of planning approaches that: (1) connect planning to ecological limits; (2) provide guidance for tackling the sustainability challenges in developing countries; and (3) offer guidance to private sector organizations about how to engage in broader planning debates on societal levels. From these findings, a future research agenda is proposed that examines how organizations can plan for a sustainable future, establish a fit between planning approaches, tools and sustainability challenges, adapt governance and organizational structures for transformative change, and design for and facilitate future change. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Collaborative planning; Strategic planning; Sustainability; Sustainable future; Systematic review","Developing countries; Ecology; Planning; Strategic planning; Collaborative approach; Collaborative planning; Organizational planning; Organizational structures; Private sector organizations; Provide guidances; Sustainable future; Systematic Review; Sustainable development","Adams, M., Wheeler, D., Woolston, G., A participatory approach to sustainable energy strategy development in a carbon-intensive jurisdiction: the case of Nova Scotia (2011) Energy Policy, 39, pp. 2550-2559; Ansell, C., Gash, A., Collaborative governance in theory and practice (2008) J.

Herein, we briefly review this nascent literature, argue that it has so far overlooked alternatives in favor of an overly planned and instrumental perspective, and consider the implications of incorporating the notion of uncertainty into investigations of how entrepreneurs engage in networking. We therefore take a novel perspective on entrepreneurial networking and theorize about how entrepreneurs act when desired ties cannot be identified in advance, networking outcomes cannot be predicted, and ongoing social interactions fuel the emergence of new objectives. Overall, we add important insights to the literature, as we flesh out a dynamic networking process that unfolds alongside efforts to create a new venture. We then discuss how this model, which highlights distinctive elements such as altruism, pre-commitment, serendipity, and co-creation, can stimulate a broader research agenda focused on the inquiry of networking agency under uncertainty. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Creation; Discovery; Effectuation; Networking behavior; Uncertainty",,"Adler, P.S., Kwon, S.-W., Social capital: prospects for a new concept (2002) Acad.

Thus, some firms have deployed field teams to their target BOP (bottom of the pyramid) markets; tasked with creating the new businesses in close cooperation with local stakeholders and consumers. In this article, I examine how two firms launched BOP ventures in a socially embedded manner and describe how this iterative approach engenders extensive shared decision making, unclear organizational boundaries, and conflicting goals. These factors obliged the field teams to construct new business opportunities that shifted the initial social and environmental goals of the initiatives: emphasizing locally valued social benefits in the businesses’ value propositions, de-emphasizing the original environmental impact objectives, and generating unforeseen positive environmental effects related to their evolved cost structures. © 2016, © 2016 SAGE Publications.","corporate BOP ventures; environmental impact; social benefits; social embeddedness",,"Aldrich, H., (1999) Organizations evolving, , London, England, Sage; Aldrich, H., Ruef, M., (2006) Organizations evolving, , 2nd ed., London, England, Sage; Alvarez, S., Barney, J., Discovery and creation: Alternative theories of entrepreneurial action (2007) Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal, 1, pp. 11-26; Anderson, R., White, R., (2009) Confessions of a radical industrialist: Profits, people, purpose: Doing business by respecting the earth, , Ashland, OR, Blackstone Audio, (unabridged ed.); Baker, T., Miner, A., Eesley, D., Improvising firms: Bricolage, account giving and improvisational competencies in the founding process (2003) Research Policy, 32, pp. 255-276; Baker, T., Nelson, R., Creating something from nothing: Resource construction through entrepreneurial bricolage (2005) Administrative Science Quarterly, 50, pp. 329-366; Battilana, J., Dorado, S., Building sustainable hybrid organizations: The case of commercial microfinance organizations (2010) Academy of Management Journal, 53, pp. 1419-1440; Bhide, A., How entrepreneurs craft strategies that work (1994) Harvard Business Review, 72 (2), pp. 150-161; Birkinshaw, J., Entrepreneurship in multinational corporations: The characteristics of subsidiary initiatives (1997) Strategic Management Journal, 18, pp. 207-229; Burgelman, R., Sayles, L., (1986) Inside corporate innovation: Strategy, structure, and managerial skills, , New York, NY, Free Press; Carlyle, T., (1966) On heroes, hero-worship and the heroic in history, , 6th ed., Lincoln, University of Nebraska Press; Chambers, R., (1997) Whose reality counts?

The results support the greater likelihood of initial sales when the entrepreneur increasingly relies on causation (albeit at low to medium levels) and has a greater perception of control. Similarly, perceived gains (instead of losses) strengthen the positive relationship between effectuation and initial sales. These results extend previous research on influence of the perceptions of control/uncontrol and gain/loss by supporting the influence of such subjective interpretations for strategic decision making.

Using primary data from industrial salespersons, the study examines how perceptions of resource availability and customer demandingness drive salesperson improvisation and condition its sales performance effects. Findings show that higher levels of salesperson improvisation are associated with increased sales performance. Additionally, a heightened perception of resource availability and greater customer demandingness are associated with increases in salesperson improvisation. Furthermore, findings indicate that the salesperson improvisation–sales performance relationship is strengthened when resource availability is greater and when customer demandingness is lower. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Customer demandingness;

Previous empirical studies have only focused on the organization-level conditions of exaptation. This paper fills the gaps by focusing on invention and inventor-level conditions such as technological complexity, inventors' analogical ability, and patent scope. To test our hypotheses, we analyse a large sample of U.S. patents obtained from the USPTO and NBER databases. Based on our findings, we discuss a number of implications of exaptation for the management of innovation as well as for policy makers. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper aims to explore the opportunity recognition process and international new venture emergence in the context of university high-technology spin-offs that are internationally market driven from inception. University spin-offs (USOs) are defined as ‘new firms created to exploit commercially some knowledge, technology or research results developed within a university’ (Pirnay et al., Small Bus Econ 21:355–369, 2003). To address this inquiry, this study imports theory from the entrepreneurship literature on organizational emergence, opportunity recognition, effectuation and the principle of individual self-efficacy. Drawing on empirical case data from four case USOs from Denmark and Ireland, this paper finds that the inventor-founders are typically engaged in opportunity recognition processes that are characterized as creative, driven by scientific innovations. It is indicated that the process of USO emergence and continuous development involves activities and interactions similar to typical international new ventures. The scientific knowledge that created opportunities for the emergence of INV-USOs across our cases endorses the view that innovation and internationalization are strongly correlated. Insights are provided on inventor-founders’ entrepreneurial intention demonstrated through activities and interactions in the on-going processes of creating the USO. Findings further highlight that self-efficacy of the inventor-founder(s) and access to specific resources (means at hand) are salient determinants for international new ventures to materialize. The study concludes with a proposed conceptual framework for further research on the creation of INV-university spin-offs. Conclusions and implications are drawn at the end of the article. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Academic entrepreneurship; Born globals; Entrepreneurial opportunity; Innovation; International entrepreneurship; International new ventures; New venture creation; University spin-offs",,"Acs, Z.J., Parsons, W., Tracy, S., (2008) High impact firms: gazelles revisited; Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behavior (1991) Organ Behav Human Decis Process, 50, pp. 179-211; Alvarez, S.A., Barney, J.B., Entrepreneurship and epistemology: the philosophical underpinnings of the study of entrepreneurial opportunities (2010) Acad Manage Ann, 4, pp. 557-583; Andersson, S., Evers, N., International opportunity recognition in international new ventures—a dynamic managerial capabilities perspective (2015) J Int Entrep, 13, pp. 260-276; Aspers, P., Empirical phenomenology: a qualitative research approach (the Cologne seminars) (2009) Indo-Pacific J Phenomenology, 9, pp. 1-12; Boyd, N.G., Vozikis, G.S., The influence of self-efficacy on the development of entrepreneurial intentions and actions (1994) Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 18, p. 63; Clarysse, B., Moray, N., A process study of entrepreneurial team formation: the case of a research-based spin-off (2004) J Bus Venturing, 19, pp. 55-79; Czarniawska, B., (1998) A narrative approach to organization studies.

Typically, those of an entrepreneurial bent are sought after for their ability to create new ventures and deliver multiple forms of societal value, such as creating jobs, bolstering the economy, and translating technology into real world applications. Yet, beyond these outcomes, at the core of entrepreneurial activities is a qualitatively distinct design approach; and thus an entrepreneurial mindset has the potential to be a powerful philosophy to scaffold thinking and solve problems in any domain. However, very little has been explicitly written about how this mindset and problem-solving philosophy could map to domains in which new ventures are not a desired outcome. This paper focuses on synthesizing and distilling the design and problem-solving strategies of the entrepreneur to make them broadly applicable beyond business centric contexts. The paper reviews multiple literature streams in entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial expertise, effectuation, entrepreneurial firm design, and entrepreneurial opportunity recognition, problem-solving and decision-making using Boyer's scholarship of integration lens as a guiding approach. This approach places value on integrating insights into new language that unifies concepts often dispersed across domains. Emphasis is placed on the design (problem solving) principles of entrepreneurs and their applicability across contexts, synthesizing such principles in a proposed framework of entrepreneurship as a problem-solving philosophy. Overall, the paper complements current research streams in entrepreneurship by helping further characterize the entrepreneurial method, while simultaneously opening new research and teaching directions, thus enriching the engineering education space and related fields. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2016.",,,"Cantillon, R., (1755) Essai sur la Nature du Commerce, , London: MacMillan for Royal Economic Society; Knight, F., (1921) Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit, , Cambridge, MA: Riverside Press; Schumpeter, J.A., (1934) The Theory of Economic Development: An Inquiry into Profits, Capital, Credit, Interest, and the Business Cycle: Transaction Books; Casson, M., (1982) The Entrepreneur: An Economic Theory, , Edward Elgar Publishing, Incorporated; Gartner, W.B., Who is an entrepreneur?

The authors apply an entrepreneurial marketing lens to explore how such entrepreneurs draw on the resources to market their businesses. They also consider whether online businesses offer such entrepreneurs the opportunity to break out of the highly competitive sectors with which they are traditionally associated. Design/methodology/approach: Key informant interviews are undertaken with 22 entrepreneurs operating online businesses in the UK and augmented by complementary sources of data such as their websites and press coverage. Findings: Use of an entrepreneurial marketing perspective demonstrates that marketing in such businesses is not haphazard or chaotic. Rather it reflects the emergent and flexible use of resources. The affordances of online businesses appear to offer opportunities for break out, but the reliance on incremental experimentation and copying others results in highly homogeneous approaches to marketing. The authors also provide empirical evidence of the link between visa status and entrepreneurial choices. Originality/value: Despite the popularity of online businesses, previous studies have not explored them as an opportunity for ethnic minority entrepreneurs. This study moves the consideration of break out from market-entry to the ongoing marketing activities that sustain a business. It also demonstrates how the domains of ethnic minority entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial marketing can be brought together via a focus on resources.

The purpose of this paper is to address the gap by developing and testing a theoretical model that links venturing principles (effectuation or causation) to new internet venture growth through resource bundling (pioneering or stabilizing). Design/methodology/approach – The proposed theoretical model is developed upon the entrepreneurship literature and resource-based view. Empirical data are collected from entrepreneurs and top executives in China via a survey. The Baron and Kenny (1986) mediation model assessment procedure is used to analyze the data. Findings – Both effectuation and causation are positively associated with new internet venture growth. Effectuation leads to pioneering resource bundling, which in turn contributes to new internet venture growth. Causation also contributes to new internet venture growth, but through stabilizing resource bundling. Research limitations/implications – This research helps link the theory of effectuation to resource-based theory by revealing resource bundling as the mediator between effectuation, causation, and new venture growth. Moreover, the authors provide empirical evidence of the importance of resource bundling with entrepreneurial strategic decision logics to the growth of new internet ventures in transitional economies. Practical implications – Entrepreneurs and managers of new internet ventures should leverage both venturing principles to support growth. Internet ventures generally are creative and innovative in nature, hence favor effectuation. But it will be unwise to ignore causation, which also leads to growth. Originality/value – This is an original empirical research guided by theories. It is a novel insight to identify the mediating effect of resource bundling. This study likely will inspire more scholarly research on the subject. It also lays a solid foundation for further inquiry such as complementarities between effectuation and causation. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Causation; Effectuation; Internet of Things; New internet venture growth; Resource bundling",,"Acquaah, M., Social networking relationships, firm-specific managerial experience and firm performance in a transition economy: a comparative analysis of family owned and nonfamily firms (2012) Strategic Management Journal, 33 (10), pp. 1215-1228. , “”; Ahlstrom, D., Bruton, G.D., Rapid institutional shifts and the co-evolution of entrepreneurial firms in transition economies (2010) Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 34 (3), pp. 531-554. , “”; Alvarez, S.A., Barney, J.B., Anderson, P., Forming and exploiting opportunities: the implications of discovery and creation processes for entrepreneurial and organizational research (2013) Organization Science, 24 (1), pp. 301-317. , “”; Andries, P., Debackere, K., Looy, B., Simultaneous experimentation as a learning strategy: business model development under uncertainty (2013) Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal, 27 (4), pp. 288-310. , “”; Ardichvili, A., Cardozo, R., Ray, S., A theory of entrepreneurial opportunity identification and development (2003) Journal of Business Venturing, 18 (1), pp. 105-123. , “”; Baker, T., Nelson, R.E., Creating something from nothing: resource construction through entrepreneurial bricolage (2005) Administrative Science Quarterly, 50 (3), pp. 329-366. , “”; Baraldi, E., Gressetvold, E., Harrison, D., Resource interaction in inter-organizational networks: foundations, comparison, and a research agenda (2012) Journal of Business Research, 65 (2), pp. 266-276. , “”; Barney, J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage (1991) Journal of Management, 17 (1), pp. 99-120. , “”; Baron, R.M., Kenny, D.A., The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations (1986) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51 (6), pp. 1173-1182. , “”; Batjargal, B., Internet entrepreneurship: social capital, human capital, and performance of new internet venture in China (2007) Research Policy, 36 (5), pp. 605-618. , “”; Batjargal, B., Network dynamics and new ventures in China: a longitudinal study (2010) Entrepreneurship and Regional Development, 22 (2), pp. 139-153. , “”; Bi, Z., Xu, L., Wang, C., Internet of things for enterprise systems of modern manufacturing (2014) IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 10 (2), pp. 1537-1546. , “”; Brettel, M., Mauer, R., Engelen, A., Küpper, D., Corporate effectuation: entrepreneurial action and its impact on R & D project performance (2012) Journal of Business Venturing, 27 (2), pp. 167-184. , “”; Brews, P.J., Hunt, M.R., Learning to plan and planning to learn: resolving the planning school/learning school debate (1999) Strategic Management Journal, 20 (10), pp. 889-913. , “”; Bridoux, F., Smith, K.G., Grimm, C.M., The management of resources temporal effects of different types of actions on performance (2013) Journal of Management, 39 (4), pp. 928-957. , “”; Cai, H., Xu, L., Xu, B., Xie, C., IoT-based configurable information service platform for product lifecycle management (2014) IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 10 (2), pp. 1558-1567. , “”; Carnes, C.M., Ireland, R.D., Familiness and innovation: resource bundling as the missing link (2013) Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 37 (6), pp. 1399-1419. , “”; Certo, S.T., Covin, J.G., Daily, C.M., Dalton, D.R., Wealth and the effects of founder management among IPO-stage new ventures (2001) Strategic Management Journal, 22 (6-7), pp. 641-658. , “”; Chaganti, R.R.S., Watts, A.D., Chaganti, R., Zimmerman-Treichel, M., Ethnic-immigrants in founding teams: effects on prospector strategy and performance in new internet venture (2008) Journal of Business Venturing, 23 (1), pp. 113-139. , “”; Chandler, G.N., DeTienne, D.R., McKelvie, A., Mumford, T.V., Effectuation and causation processes: a validation study (2011) Journal of Business Venturing, 26 (3), pp. 375-390. , “”; Chi, Q., Yan, H., Zhang, C., A reconfigurable smart sensor interface for industrial WSN in IoT environment (2014) IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 10 (2), pp. 1417-1425. , “”; Coetzee, L., Eksteen, J., (2011) The internet of things-promise for the future?

Design/methodology/approach – A multiple case study on six firms in information and communication technologies industry in China is conducted. Findings – Three types of entrepreneurial opportunities exist. These are identification type opportunity, discovery type opportunity, and creation type opportunity. Entrepreneurship among the three types of entrepreneurial opportunities operates under different laws. For each type of entrepreneurial opportunity, firms need to balance the two growth modes, namely, the opportunity identification and assessment/resource allocation mode and the opportunity utilization and resource identification/acquisition mode, in order to achieve a leveraging effect. Research limitations/implications – Vertical comparison is missing. Practical implications – Firms need to balance the two growth modes, namely, opportunity identification and assessment and resource allocation mode and opportunity utilization and resource identification and acquisition mode, to achieve leverage effect. Originality/value – This paper integrates system theory with entrepreneurship research and proposes the opportunity and resource integrative entrepreneurial growth model. This model is helpful, both in aiding firms to follow the laws for entrepreneurial opportunities and to identify entrepreneurial opportunities. The business model plays a vital role in entrepreneurship. Firms taking advantage of the Internet of Things are more likely to gain a competitive advantage and to achieve success in their entrepreneurial activities. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Case study; Entrepreneurship; Internet of Things; Leverage effect; Opportunity; Resources",,"Acs, Z.J., Braunerhjelm, P., Audretsch, D.B., Carlsson, B., The knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship (2009) Small Business Economics, 32 (1), pp. 15-30. , “”; Adam, U., Tan, M.I.I., Desa, M.I., (2010) Logistics and information technology: previous research and future research expansion, pp. 242-246. , “”; Alam, S., Chowdhury, M.M., Noll, J., (2010) Senaas: an event-driven sensor virtualization approach for internet of things cloud, pp. 1-6. , “”; Alvarez, S.A., Barney, J.B., How do entrepreneurs organize firms under conditions of uncertainty?

In the healthcare sector, Apple Healthkit and Google Fit are emerging digital platforms for managing fitness data and developing a connected market. Technology firms should consider platform complementor roles as alternatives to so-called traditional means of entering markets. As complementors, they can use not only the stable technological core maintained by the platform owner, but also dynamic elements being co-created among participants. Accumulating end-user data, processes, user experience and emerging social community in the platform increase uncertainty and challenge complementors to continuously adapt their decision making. This paper reports results of an interview study on digital health-platform complementor motives, and argues that complementors need effectual logic instead of causal logic in contributing to an emerging digital platform. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Commerce; Decision making; Causal logic; Digital platforms; Dynamic elements; Economy and society; Healthcare sectors; Interview study; Social communities; User experience; Health","Smedlund, A., Faghankhani, H., Platform orchestration for efficiency, development and innovation (2015) Proceedings of the 48th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences; Smedlund, A., Value cocreation in service platform business models (2012) Serv.

Thus, we investigate the relevance/role of a business plan analysis in developing a new business (new biobased value chains) in the case of citrus waste valorisation. We look primarily at the inherent uncertainty associated with the start-up phase of a new business aimed at producing and wholesaling semi-finished products derived from the recovery of citrus waste in southern Italy. In order to do so, we use a qualitative case study approach focusing on a small citrus waste valorisation firm located in Calabria, using Agro Management Development (AMD) as a unit of analysis. The choice of this research setting is not random, given the fact that many companies from the Mediterranean are trying to engage in activities to valorise citrus waste deriving from production value chains. The main findings of our analysis can be summarized as follows: (i) focusing primarily on one area of uncertainty (i.e., market uncertainty) might undermine chances of success, as it could indicate an incomplete business strategy to stakeholders, hence hindering their willingness to commit to a new entrepreneurial initiative; (ii) although a business plan could be an effective way to narrow down uncertainty for a new innovative firm, it should be properly customised in order to address all relevant dimensions of uncertainty. Indeed, an insufficiently developed plan might be counterproductive, revealing (for instance, to possible investors) an inadequate strategy for facing and solving emerging problems, therefore putting the whole business project at risk. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Business plan; Citrus waste valorization; Uncertainty",,"Ki Lin, C.S., Pfaltzgraff, L.A., Herrero-Davila, L., Mubofu, E.B., Abderrahim, S., Clark, J.H., Koutinas, A.A., Dickson, F., Food waste as a valuable resource for the production of chemicals, materials and fuels.

Many organizations value the advantages obtained when they are able to align their business and IT strategies. Although considerable models and frameworks have been developed to support organizations in their quest of achieving and sustaining BITA, still many of them face challenges because of some influential factors. While factors influencing BITA in organizations have been widely studied, the barriers in achieving BITA in the banking sector of a developing country remain largely unexplored. In this study we aim at exploring the factors that hinder BITA in the banking sector of a developing country. A case study research was conducted in four commercial banks in Burkina Faso with branches in more than ten other African countries. The data was collected through semi-structured interviews and also from internal documents and has been thematically analyzed. The main findings in this study shows that the delay in task execution, the lack of time to acquire new knowledge, the insufficiency of cross-sectional trainings, the dependency on telecom operators, the heavy workload of banking staff and the reluctance to hire more personnel considerably hinder BITA within the banks in Burkina Faso as a developing country. The results contribute to research in BITA and the limited knowledge about the factors hindering BITA in the banking sector of a developing country. Moreover the results of this research can help IT and business practitioners to further elaborate organizational skills training programs necessary for banks to improve their personnel's performance throughout their journey towards BITA. © 2016 The Authors.","Banking sector; Burkina Faso; Business-IT alignment; Developing country; Factors","Computer supported cooperative work; Developing countries; Information systems; Personnel training; Project management; Societies and institutions; Banking sectors; Burkina Faso; Business - IT alignments; Business practitioners; Factors; Influential factors; Organizational skills; Semi structured interviews; Information management","Kappelman, L., Johnson, V., McLean, E., Torres, R., The 2015 SIM IT Issues and Trends Study (2016) MIS Quarterly Executive, 15 (1), pp. 55-83; Luftman, J.N., Bullen, C.V., Liao, D., Neumann, C., (2004) Managing Information Technology Resource, , Leadership in the Information Age, Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education Inc; Colton, T., Tallon, P., Sharma, R., Queiroz, M., Strategic, I.T., Alignment: Twenty five years on (2015) Journal of Information Technology, 30, pp. 91-100; Kearns, G.S., Lederer, A.L., The Effect of Strategic Alignment on the use of IS-Based Resources for Competitive Advantage (2000) Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 9 (4), pp. 265-293; Luftman, J., Kempaiah, R., An update on business-IT alignment: 'A line' has been drawn (2007) MIS Quarterly Executive, 6 (3), pp. 165-177; Leonard, J., Seddon, P., A Meta-model of Alignment (2012) Communications of the Association for Information Systems, 31 (11), pp. 231-259; Chan, Y.E., Sabherwal, R., Thatcher, J.B., Antecedents and outcomes of strategic IS alignment: An empirical investigation (2006) IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 53 (1), pp. 27-47; Iman, N., Hartono, J., Strategic Alignment Impacts on Organizational Performance in Indonesian Banking Industry (2007) Gadjah Mada International Journal of Business, 9 (2), pp. 253-272; Silvius, A.J.G., Business & IT alignment in theory and practice (2007) Proceedings of the 40th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, , Hawaii, USA: IEEE Computer Society; Surti, B.C., (2011) Business-IT Alignment: Shall the Twain Ever Meet?

Results indicate that participants tend to shift toward more intuitive-based decision-making styles after participating in scenario planning. These findings support and add further evidence to previous investigations into decision-making style and scenario planning. To explore this relationship, we employed a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest one-group design with scenario planning as the intervention. Confirmatory factor analysis provided validity of measurement scores and pair samples t tests were used to test hypotheses on the five factors of the General Decision-Making Styles Survey (GDMS). This study documents the responses from participants (n = 170) from 10 organizations using the General Decision-Making Style Survey.","Decision-making styles; Long-range planning; Mental models; Scenario planning; Strategic thinking",,"Ader, H.J., Mellenbergh, G.J., Hand, D.J., (2008) Advising on Research Methods: A Consultant's Companion, , Huizen, Netherlands: Johannes van Kessel Publishing; Allison, G.T., (1971) Essence of Decision: Explaining the Cuban Missile Crisis, , Boston, MA: Little Brown; Anderson, P.A., Decision making by objection and the Cuban Missile Crisis (1983) Administrative Science Quarterly, 28 (2), pp. 201-202; Andrews, K.R., (1971) The Concept of Corporate Strategy, , Homewood, IL: Dow Jones-Irwin; Arnold, H.J., Feldman, D.C., Social desirability response bias in self-report choice situations (1981) The Academy of Management Journal, 24 (2), pp. 377-385; Bolman, L.G., (2008) Reframing Organizations Artistry, Choice, and Leadership, , San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass; Bradfield, R.M., Cognitive barriers in the scenario development process (2008) Advances in Development Human Resources, 10 (2), pp. 198-215; Browne, M., (1993) Organizational Decision Making and Information, , NOwrood, NJ: Ablex Publishing; Bryson, J.M., (2004) Strategic Planning for Public and Nonprofit Organizations: A Guide to Strenthening and Sustaining Organizational Achievement, , San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass; Burke, L.A., Miller, M.K., Taking the mystery out of intuitive decision making (1999) The Academy of Management Executive, 13 (4), pp. 91-99; Burt, G., van der Heijden, K., First steps: Toward purposeful activities in scenario thinking and future studies (2003) Futures, 35 (10), pp. 1011-1026; Carmines, E.G., (1979) Reliability and Validity Assessment, , Beverly Hills, CA: Sage Publications; Chandler, A.D., (1990) Strategy and Structure Chapters in the History of the Industrial Enterprise, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Chermack, T.J., Improving decision making with scenario planning (2004) Futures, 36 (3), pp. 295-309; Chermack, T.J., Studying scenario planning: Theory, research suggestions, and hypotheses (2005) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 72 (1), pp. 59-73; Chermack, T.J., (2011) Scenario planning in organizations how to create, use, and assess scenarios, , San Francisco: Berrett-Koehler; Chermack, T.J., Lynham, S.A., Definitions and Outcome Variables of Scenario Planning (2002) Human Resource Development Review, 1 (3), pp. 366-383; Chermack, T.J., Nimon, K., The effects of scenario planning on participant decision-making style (2008) Human Resource Development Quarterly, 19 (4), pp. 351-372; Cohen, J., (1988) Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences, , Hillsdale, NJ: L.

The present research had three objectives: to develop a conceptual framework for categorizing managerial market definitions, to investigate empirically how practitioners frame novel markets, and to identify challenges associated with creating innovative market definitions in traditional industrial networks. The chapter draws on data collected within an extensive research program, carried out between March 2009 and December 2010. The program consisted of six academic research projects covering a wide range of theoretical backgrounds as well as interactions with 112 senior managers from ten major firms in a series of 52 workshops. The proposed conceptual framework supplements the current dominant product-based view of market definitions by positing that managers in industrial networks can also choose to define their markets based on (1) the firm’s resources and capabilities, (2) the network’s resources and capabilities, (3) the customers’ processes, and (4) the end-consumers’ practices. The results of the study additionally showed that current product-based theories of markets also influence managerial judgment: practitioners framed the vast majority of new market opportunities (73 %) around the product or service being sold. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.",,,"Alvesson, M., Sköldberg, K., (2009) Reflexive methodology: New vistas for qualitative research, , London: Sage; Amit, R., Zott, C., Value creation in e-business (2001) Strategic Manage Journal, 22 (6-7), pp. 493-520; Andersson, P., Aspenberg, K., Kjellberg, H., The configuration of actors in market practice (2008) Marketing Theory, 8 (1), pp. 67-80; Araujo, L., Markets, market-making and marketing (2007) Marketing Theory, 3, pp. 211-226; Arnould, E.J., Thompson, C.J., Consumer culture theory (CCT): Twenty years of research (2005) Journal of Consumer Research, 31 (4), pp. 868-882; Azimont, F., Araujo, L., Category reviews as market-shaping events (2007) Industrial Market Management, 36 (7), pp. 849-860; Barney, J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage (1991) Journal of Management, 17 (1), pp. 99-120; Berry, L.L., Relationship marketing (1983) Emerging perspectives on services marketing, pp. 25-28. , L.

We build on literatures in stakeholder and cognitive theory to examine the effects of situational complexity and novelty on an entrepreneur's ethical judgement. Our conceptual framework shows how confirmation biases and inward biases affect the ethical judgement of entrepreneurs. We test our theory using cross country data from the World Values Survey. We find that the ethical judgement of self-employed individuals is lower than that of non-entrepreneurs and that differences are moderated by the complexity and novelty of their decision setting. We also find that the ethical judgement of entrepreneurs with low levels of entrepreneurial initiative is the lowest, especially in moderately complex and novel decision settings. We argue that these findings have important implications for stakeholder approaches to entrepreneurial ethics.

We approach this choice from a strategic decision-making perspective, by implementing a game theory approach to analyse the selection process. Three main groups of players were identified: faculty members or academicians, university management members, and board of trustees' members. The decisions of these players were then analysed by the use of a Fuzzy TOPSIS method. Our findings show how, in choosing from the options continuum, the players arrived at equilibria points that best satisfied their collective perspectives as to the required balance, for the purpose of achieving optimal benefit. © Università del Salento.","Fuzzy TOPSIS method; Game theory; Research/teaching continuum; Strategic-decision making process",,"Amason, A.C., Distinguishing the effects of functional and dysfunctional con-ict on strategic decision making: Resolving a paradox for top management teams (1996) Academy of management journal, 39 (1), pp. 123-148; Aplak, H.S., Sogut, M.Z., Game theory approach in decisional process of energy management for industrial sector (2013) Energy Conversion and Management, 74, pp. 70-80; Armstrong, J.S., Sperry, T., The ombudsman: Business school prestigeresearch versus teaching (1994) Interfaces, 24 (2), pp. 13-43; Boyer, E.L., The scholarship of teaching from: Scholarship reconsidered: Priorities of the professoriate (1991) College Teaching, 39 (1), pp. 11-13; Boyer, E.L., The scholarship of engagement (1996) Bulletin of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 49 (7), pp. 18-33; Camerer, C., (2003) Behavioral game theory: Experiments in strategic interaction, , Princeton University Press; Camerer, C.F., Ho, T.-H., Chong, J.-K., A cognitive hierarchy model of games (2004) The Quarterly Journal of Economics, pp. 861-898; Chu, T.-C., Lin, Y.-C., A fuzzy topsis method for robot selection (2003) The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 21 (4), pp. 284-290; Colman, A.M., (2013) Game theory and its applications: In the social and biological sciences, , Psychology Press; Cummings, W.K., Shin, J.C., Teaching and research in contemporary higher education: An overview (2014) Teaching and research in contemporary higher education, pp. 1-12. , Springer; Eisenhardt, K.M., Zbaracki, M.J., Strategic decision making (1992) Strategic management journal, 13, pp. 17-37; Elbanna, S., Strategic decision-making: Process perspectives (2006) International Journal of Management Reviews, 8 (1), pp. 1-20; Elbanna, S., Managers' autonomy, strategic control, organizational politics and strategic planning effectiveness: An empirical investigation into missing links in the hotel sector (2016) Tourism Management, 52, pp. 210-220; Elbanna, S., Child, J., In uences on strategic decision effectiveness: Development and test of an integrative model (2007) Strategic Management Journal, 28 (4), pp. 431-453; Ferris, G.R., Treadway, D.C., Perrewé, P.L., Brouer, R.L., Douglas, C., Lux, S., Political skill in organizations (2007) Journal of Management, 33 (3), pp. 290-320; Garbuio, M., Lovallo, D., Sibony, O., Evidence doesn't argue for itself: The value of disinterested dialogue in strategic decision-making (2015) Long Range Planning, 48 (6), pp. 361-380; Hatch, M.J., The dynamics of organizational culture (1993) Academy of management review, 18 (4), pp. 657-693; Hsu, H.-M., Chen, C.-T., Fuzzy credibility relation method for multiple criteria decision-making problems (1997) Information Sciences, 96 (1), pp. 79-91; Hung, H.-K., Yeh, R.-S., Shih, H.-Y., Voice behavior and performance ratings: The role of political skill (2012) International Journal of Hospitality Management, 31 (2), pp. 442-450; Jiang, Y.-P., Fan, Z.-P., Ma, J., A method for group decision making with multi-granularity linguistic assessment information (2008) Information Sciences, 178 (4), pp. 1098-1109; Johnson, G., Whittington, R., Scholes, K., Angwin, D., RegnŽr, P., (2013) Exploring Strategy Text & Cases, , Pearson Higher Ed; Kaplan, S., Orlikowski, W.J., Temporal work in strategy making (2013) Organization Science, 24 (4), pp. 965-995; McKelvie, A., Haynie, J.M., Gustavsson, V., Unpacking the uncertainty construct: Implications for entrepreneurial action (2011) Journal of Business Venturing, 26 (3), pp. 273-292; Miller, C.C., Ireland, R.D., Intuition in strategic decision making: friend or foe in the fast-paced 21st century?

This study outlines promising avenues for future research for the two concepts’ connections and synergies. Four research themes are identified and presented: Design Thinking and opportunity recognition/creation, Design Thinking and effectuation in corporate entrepreneurship, Design Thinking and corporate entrepreneurship strategy, as well as entrepreneurial design management. Promising avenues for each research theme are identified. Two of the research themes are on an individual level, while the other two themes are on an organizational level. The study contributes to the fields of corporate entrepreneurship and Design Thinking by conceptually linking the two, presenting research in the field and noting avenues for further research. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Corporate entrepreneurship; Corporate entrepreneurship strategy; Design; Design thinking; Effectuation; Entrepreneurial opportunity; Management",,"Abrell, T., Durstewitz, M., (2014) User Involvement in Internal Corporate Venturing: The Viewpoint of The Corporate Entrepreneur, pp. 1-13. , CINet conference 2014, Budapest; Abrell, T., Uebernickel, F., Design thinking and corporate entrepreneurship: An exploratory study (2014) Proceedings of the 19Th DMI: Academic Design Management Conference, pp. 1887-1903. , Bohemia E, Rieple A, Liedtka J, Cooper R, London; Abrell, T., Durstewitz, M., Uebernickel, F., Design thinking and effectuation in internal corporate venturing: An exploratory study (2014) Proceedings 24Th Annual RESER Conference Services and New Societal Challenges: Innovation for Sustainable Growth and Welfare, pp. 7-15. , Toivonen M, Sept 11-13, Helsinki; Anthony, S.D., Eyring, M., Gibson, L., Mapping your innovation strategy (2006) Harv Bus Rev, 84 (5), pp. 104-113; Antoncic, B., Risk taking in intrapreneurship: Translating the individual level risk aversion into the organizational risk taking (2003) J Enterp Cult, 11 (1), pp. 1-23; Antoncic, B., Intrapreneurship: A comparative structural equation modeling study (2007) Ind Manag Data Syst, 107 (3), pp. 309-325; Antoncic, J.A., Antoncic, B., Employee satisfaction, intrapreneurship and firm growth: A model (2011) Ind Manag Data Syst, 111 (4), pp. 589-607; Antoncic, B., Hisrich, R.D., Intrapreneurship: Construct refinement and cross-cultural validation (2001) J Bus Ventur, 16 (5), pp. 495-527; Antoncic, B., Hisrich, R.D., Clarifying the intrapreneurship concept (2003) J Small Bus Enterp Dev, 10 (1), pp. 7-24; Archer, G.R., Baker, T., Mauer, R., Towards an alternative theory of entrepreneurial success: Integrating bricolage, effectuation and improvisation (2009) Front Entrep Res, 29 (6), pp. 1-15; Ardichvili, A., Cardozo, R., Ray, S., A theory of entrepreneurial opportunity identification and development (2003) J Bus Ventur, 18 (1), pp. 105-123; Baden-Fuller, C., Strategic innovation, corporate entrepreneurship and matching outside-in to inside-out approaches to strategy research (1995) Br J Manag, 6, pp. 3-16; Baron, R.A., Opportunity recognition as pattern recognition: How entrepreneurs “connect the dots” to identify new business opportunities (2006) Acad Manag Perspect, 20 (1), pp. 104-119; Barrett, H., Weinstein, A., The effect of market orientation and organizational flexibility on corporate entrepreneurship (1998) Enterp Theory Pract, 23 (1), pp. 57-70; Barringer, B.R., Bluedorn, A.C., The relationship between corporate entrepreneurship and strategic management (1999) Strateg Manag J, 20 (5), pp. 421-444; Biggadike, R., The risky business of diversification (1979) Harv Bus Rev, 57 (3), pp. 103-111; Bluedorn, A.C., Johnson, R.A., Cartwright, D.K., Barringer, B.R., The interface and convergence of the strategic management and organizational environment domains (1994) J Manag, 20 (2), pp. 201-262; Bogers, M., Afuah, A., Bastian, B., Users as innovators: A review, critique, and future research directions (2010) J Manag, 36 (4), pp. 857-875; Bradley, S.W., Wiklund, J., Shepherd, D.A., Swinging a double-edged sword: The effect of slack on entrepreneurial management and growth (2011) J Bus Ventur, 26 (5), pp. 537-554; Brettel, M., Mauer, R., Engelen, A., Kiipper, D., Corporate effectuation: Entrepreneurial action and its impact on R&D project performance (2012) J Bus Ventur, 27 (2), pp. 167-184; Brown, T., (2008) Design Thinking.

In this study, hypotheses are formulated to understand the relationship between effectuation, technology orientation, and firm performance. The study takes place in South Africa, which remains a highly significant economic player in sub-Saharan Africa, and is focused on the renewable energy sector. Survey results provide evidence that different dimensions of effectuation are positively associated with technology orientation, and influence firm performance.

We use four dimensions – decision making, organization, process, and external interaction – as the analytical framework. Building on five empirical case studies in the Finnish residential sector, the article identifies various approaches to integrating planning and execution during the development process. Furthermore, the article identifies four integrative mechanisms that relate to each of the four analytical dimensions. The key proposition is that the integration between planning and execution is the driving force for innovation, and that the locus of this integration is the practical engagement of actors with specific aims, problems, and means at hand related to the emerging solution. Finally, the article identifies the availability of, or access to, service-provision resources and the customer interface as a key enabler of this integration. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","customer interface; execution; innovation; planning; service resources","decision making; innovation; planning process; service sector; Finland","Alam, I., An exploratory investigation of user involvement in new service development (2002) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 30, pp. 250-261; Alvarez, S.A., Barney, J.B., Discovery and creation: Alternative theories of entrepreneurial action (2007) Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal, 1, pp. 11-26; Baker, T., Nelson, R.E., Creating something from nothing: Resource construction through entrepreneurial bricolage (2005) Administrative Science Quarterly, 50, pp. 329-366; Bledow, R., Frese, M., Anderson, N., Erez, M., Farr, J., A dialectic perspective on innovation: Conflicting demands, multiple pathways, and ambidexterity (2009) Industrial and Organizational Psychology, 2, pp. 305-337; de Brentani, U., New industrial service development: Scenarios for success and failure (1995) Journal of Business Research, 32, pp. 93-103; Cheng, Y.-T., van de Ven, A.H., Learning the innovation journey: Order out of chaos?

Any entrepreneur that seeks to start a new venture in an emerging industry will face resource and time constraints. The question we raise here is how the entrepreneur should prioritize use of time and resources to increase likeliness of success. To address this question we depart from a theoretical perspective of entrepreneurship seen as judgment, and bridges it over to entrepreneurship seen as co-creation. In other words, we combine the subjective with the intersubjective, and explore the effects of the actions successful green technology entrepreneurs in the emerging offshore renewable energy industry make in building their new ventures in nascent markets. Inspired by earlier studies on market entry, combined with new ways to understand new venture emergence, we find that independent entrepreneurs benefit from leapfrogging typical stages in the technology development process and rather devote time and efforts on resource acquisition. We also find that the most important value-capturing, decision-making heuristics are those related to ""hybrid governance"". We discuss implications for theory, practice, and policy. © 2015 by the authors.","Greentech; Heuristics; International entrepreneurship; Marine renewable energy; Sustainability; Uncertainty; Unpredictive strategy","alternative energy; energy market; entrepreneur; international agreement; offshore application; renewable resource; resource availability; strategic approach; sustainability; uncertainty analysis","Vesper, K.H., (1990) New Venture Strategies: Revised Edition, , Prentice Hall: Englewood Cliffs, NJ, USA; Oviatt, B.M., McDougall, P.P., Toward a Theory of International New Ventures (1994) J.

There is however little research relating the concept of ambiguity tolerance (AT) to participants in new product development (NPD) projects. This paper adds to previous research where AT has been studied among entrepreneurs and managers. It shows that NPD team members in a variety of innovation-related roles can exhibit both tolerance and intolerance for ambiguity. To explain the seeming contradiction, this paper suggests distinguishing between dispositional AT as a personality variable and enacted AT as a behavioural variable. This research contributes towards a wider theoretical understanding of AT among NPD project participants, and proposes a new agenda for further research on AT in innovation. This research agenda will have managerial implications as it can improve an organisation's ability to succeed in NPD by selecting project managers and team members with appropriate capabilities to manage ambiguity. © 2015 Imperial College Press.","Ambiguity tolerance; innovation; new product development; roles",,"Ahmed, P.K., Culture and climate for innovation (1998) European Journal of Innovation Management, 1 (1), pp. 30-43; Begley, T.M., Boyd, D.P., Psychological characteristics associated with performance in entrepreneurial firms and smaller businesses (1987) Journal of Business Venturing, 2 (1), pp. 79-93; Brun, E., Sætre, A.S., Ambiguity reduction in new product development projects (2008) International Journal of Innovation Management, 12 (4), pp. 573-596; Brun, E., Sætre, A.S., Managing ambiguity in new product development (2009) Creativity and Innovation Management, 18 (1), pp. 24-34; Brun, E., Sætre, A.S., Gjelsvik, M., Benefits of ambiguity in new product development (2008) International Journal of Innovation and Technology Management, 5 (3), pp. 303-319; Brun, E., Sætre, A.S., Gjelsvik, M., Classification of ambiguity in new product development projects (2009) European Journal of Innovation Management, 12 (1), pp. 62-85; Budner, S., Intolerance of ambiguity as a personality variable (1962) Journal of Personality, 30 (1), p. 29; Callaway, M.R., Marriott, R.G., Esser, J.K., Effects of dominance on group decision making: Toward a stress-reduction explanation of groupthink (1985) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 49 (4), pp. 949-952; Cliff, J.E., Jennings, P.D., Greenwood, R., New to the game and questioning the rules: The experiences and beliefs of founders who start imitative versus innovative firms (2006) Journal of Business Venturing, 21 (5), pp. 633-663; Dyer, J.H., Gregersen, H.B., Christensen, C.M., Entrepreneur behaviors, opportunity recognition, and the origins of innovative ventures (2008) Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal, 2 (4), pp. 317-338; Eisenberg, E., Ambiguity as strategy in organizational communication (1984) Communication Monographs, 51, pp. 227-242; Furnham, A., Ribchester, T., Tolerance of ambiguity: A review of the concept, its measurement and applications (1995) Current Psychology, 14 (3), p. 179; Griffin, A., Hoffmann, N., Price, R.L., Vojak, B.A., (2007) How Serial Innovators Navigate the Fuzzy Front End of New Product Development ISBM Report, 3. , Institute for the Study of Business Markets, The Pennsylvania State University; Jung, C.G., (1923) Psychological Types, , London: Routledge & Kegan Paul; Lane, D., Maxfield, R., Strategy under complexity: Fostering generative relationships (1996) Long Range Planning, 29 (2), pp. 215-231; McNally, R.C., Durmusoglu, S.S., Calantone, R.J., Harmancioglu, N., Exploring new product portfolio management decisions: The role of managers' dispositional traits (2009) Industrial Marketing Management, 38 (1), pp. 127-143; Nonaka, I., Takeuchi, H., (1995) The Knowledge-Creating Company.

The objective is to understand to what extend the digital stakeholders participate in the construction of an effectuale entrepreneurial approach. A grounded theory approach has been used to study the creation of a company which rent vehicles of collection online. The model of creation was translated into scenarios and tested with nine entrepreneurs and five project leaders. Resulats reveal that the entrepreneur acts as an network-actor and that digital stakeholders, organized in community, participate in the construction the effectuale entrepreneurial approach. In that matter, we specify the approach of Sarasvathy's effectuale entrepreneurial approach.

One camp has touted the merits of formal, deliberate strategic planning, while the other camp has maintained that strategy simply emerges over time as a firm takes various actions in response to environmental stimuli. Recently, researchers have recognized the more realistic view that deliberately planned strategies transform during implementation through an emergent strategy formation process. This chapter will review the literature on deliberate and emergent strategies, exploring the perspectives of the proponents and critics from each academic camp. It will then examine the two perspectives as ends of a continuum, citing a number of strategy types that exist between the end points. The concept of planned emergence, or a complementary deliberate and emergent approach, will next be discussed followed by an examination of the numerous empirical studies that have sought a link between formal strategic planning and organizational performance. Finally, a discussion of the emergent impact of chaotic systems and improvisation on deliberate strategy will be followed by perspectives on the future of strategy creation and implementation. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015.","Chaotic systems; Deliberate strategy; Emergent strategy; Planned emergence; Planning versus performance; Strategic planning; Strategy creation; Strategy formulation; Strategy implementation; Strategy improvisation",,"Andersen, T.J., Integrating decentralized strategy making and strategic planning processes in dynamic environments (2004) J Manag Stud, 41, pp. 1271-1299; Andrews, K.R., (1971) The concept of corporate strategy, , Dow Jones-Irwin, Homewood; Ansoff, H.I., Critique of Henry Mintzberg’s ‘The design school: Reconsidering the basic premises of strategic management’ (1991) Strateg Manag J, 12 (6), pp. 449-461; Ashill, N.J., Frederikson, M., Davies, J., Strategic marketing planning: A grounded investigation (2003) Eur J Market, 37 (3-4), pp. 430-460; (2003) Bain study reveals how firms are using three main analytical tools, , Financial Times, 4th Sept 2003; Blythe, J., Zimmerman, A., Strategic planning for global markets (2004) Market Rev, 4, pp. 369-384; Boyd, B.K., Strategic planning and financial performance: A meta-analytic review (1991) J Manag Stud, 28 (4), pp. 353-374; Boyd, B.K., Reuning-Elliot, E., A measurement model of strategic planning (1998) Strateg Manag J, 19, p. 181; Bradbury, H., Lichtenstein, B.M.B., Relationality in organizational research: Exploring the space between (2000) Organ Sci, 11 (5), p. 551; Brews, P.J., Hunt, M.R., Learning to plan and planning to learn: Resolving the planning school/learning school debate (1999) Strateg Manag J, 20 (10), pp. 889-913; (2004), Katherine Barber (ed.). 2nd edn.

Through a comparative case analysis, this paper looks at what firms do to make the information usable and create value. It explores factors that cause different firms to respond differently to the same trends. It analyzes the passenger car segment of the automobile industry and the response of six major firms to fossil fuel and changing environmental regulations through an analysis of their policies and strategic activities, such as new product development. It finds foresight to be an important link between firm capabilities and environmental changes. Design/methodology/approach – This paper adopts the case approach to capture the linkage between the issue and the context (Yin, 1994) and uses multiple cases to explore the variables by comparing and contrasting the cases on key aspects (Eisenhardt and Graebner, 2007). As the paper's objective is to understand the similarities and differences between dominant firms in the sector, it chooses through theoretical sampling, six firms that have a presence in all the major regions of the world – two each from the USA, Europe and Japan – Ford, General Motors, Volkswagen, Renault, Toyota and Honda. This sample represents the firms and regions traditionally strong in the passenger car industry. Findings – Thus, it is seen that the relationship that was posited in the conceptual model between the goal of the firms, the vision of the future and the nature of products and approach to technology/competence development seems to be valid. However, in addition, the paper perceives that some additional linkages that link between foresight and the goals and vision of the future seem to be influenced by the extent of uncertainty. In addition, the decisions regarding portfolio of products and approaches to technology and competence development seem to be also influenced by the perception of existing competencies and the external competitive context. Research limitations/implications – This paper was based on multiple cases created out of secondary information, hence the constructs used are those which are perceived and stated. Practical implications – The paper could help firms understand decisions related to technology choices in field involving high levels of uncertainty and competition. Social implications – This paper could improve learning processes from foresight exercises, and enable strategic decisions to be taken on these. Originality/value – Thus, this paper has explored the linkages between what firms perceive and state, and what is reflected in their actions. It has looked at this linkage from the perspective of foresight, and the strategic perspective of the firm. It has come up with additional issues and questions that influence this relationship. These can inform future research in this domain. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Automotive industry; Forecasting; Strategic planning; Uncertainty management",,"Adner, R., Kapoor, R., Value creation in innovation ecosystems: how the structure of technological interdependence affects firm performance in new technology generations (2010) Strategic Management Journal, 31 (3), pp. 306-333; Anonymous, A., Renault’s woes, carmakers (2011) The Economist, 399 (8736), p. 78. , p; Ansoff, H.I., Managing strategic surprise by response to weak signals (1975) California Management Review, 18 (2), pp. 21-33; Barker, D., Smith, D.J.H., Technology foresight using roadmaps (1995) Long Range Planning, 28 (2), pp. 21-28; Battistella, C., The organization of corporate foresight: a multiple case study in the telecommunications industry (2014) Technology Forecasting and Social Change, 87, pp. 60-69; Bennet, J., (2014) General Motors to debut next-generation Chevrolet Volt in January; GM to Unveil 2016 plug-in hybrid at Detroit Auto Show, , 7August; Bohnsack, R., Pinkse, J., Kolk, A., Business model for sustainable technologies, exploring business model evolution in the case of electric vehicles (2014) Research Policy, 43 (2), pp. 284-300; Bright, J.R., Evaluating signals of technological change (1970) Harvard Business Review, 48 (1), pp. 62-70; Brown, J.S., Minding and mining the periphery (2004) Long Range Planning, 37 (2), pp. 143-151; Cohen, B., Winn, M.I., Market imperfections, opportunity and sustainable entrepreneurship (2007) Journal of Business Venturing, 22 (1), pp. 29-49; Costano, L.A., Strategic foresight in a high speed environment (2004) Futures, 36 (2), pp. 219-235; Daim, T., Harell, G., Hogaboam, L., Forecasting renewable energy production in the US (2012) Foresight, 14 (3), pp. 225-241; D’Aveni, R.A., (1994) Hypercompetition: Managing the Dynamics of Strategic Maneuvering, , Free PressNew YorkNY:; Dutton, J.E., Duncan, R.B., The influence of the strategic planning process on strategic change (1987) Strategic Management Journal, 8 (2), pp. 103-116; Eisenhardt, K.M., Graebner, M.E., Theory building from cases: opportunities and challenges (2007) Academy of Management Journal, 50 (1), pp. 25-32; Ford, F., (2012) Annual Report 2012, , Ford MotorsDearbornMichigan:; Ford, F., (2013) Annual Report, 2013, , Ford MotorsDearbornMichigan:; Galbraith, C.S., Merrill, G.B., The politics of forecasting: managing the truth (1996) California Management Review, 38 (2), pp. 29-43; General Motors, G.M., (2012) Annual Report, 2012, , General MotorsDearbornMichigan:; General Motors, G.M., (2013) Annual Report, 2013, , General MotorsDearbornMichigan:; General Motors, G.M., (2013) Sustainability Report, 2013, , General MotorsDearbornMichigan:; General Motors, G.M., (2014) Annual Report, 2014, , General MotorsDearbornMichigan:; Hambrick, D.C., Environmental scanning and organizational strategy (1982) Strategic Management Journal, 3 (2), pp. 159-174; Hoffman, A.J., Ocasio, W., Not all events are attended equally: toward a middle-range theory of industry attention to external events (2001) Organization Science, 12 (4), pp. 414-434; Honda, H., (2012) Striving to be a Company Society Wants to Exist, CSR Report 2012, , Honda MotorsTokyo:; Hubers, C., Lyons, G., Assessing future travel demand: a need to account for non transport technologies?

An econometric analysis examines the returns on business angels’ investments and their major determinants, making reference to an original set of independent variables. Whereas previous empirical studies have hypothesised linear relationships between the explanatory variables and the performance of informal venture capitalists’ investments, this work tests different functional forms, both linear and non-linear. The main findings are as follows: (1) the relationship between experience and internal rate of return (IRR) is U-shaped and significant; (2) the widely accepted expectation that investments with a short holding period earn a lower IRR is confirmed by quantitative data; (3) an original explanatory variable – rejection rate – is put into the model and its impact on business angels’ performance is positive, non-linear and significant; (4) the final overall econometric model shows relevant explanatory power, with an R-squared close to 35%. The outcomes of the empirical analysis performed in this study allow the identification of new and concrete insights into possible public policy interventions aimed at stimulating the informal venture capital industry and, therefore, entrepreneurship inside the economic system. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","business angels; determinants of performance; experience; funding gap; holding period; informal venture capital; IRR; rejection rate",,"(2013) Annual Report 2012, , www.aifi.it; (2010) Annual Report 2009, , www.aifi.it; (2011) Annual Report 2010, , www.aifi.it; (2012) Annual Report 2011, , www.aifi.it; Aernoudt, R., Business Angels: Should They Fly on Their Own Wings?

Unlike optimistic explanations, this ambiguity-averse form of overconfidence offers a non-probabilistic approach to entrepreneurial judgements of uncertainty. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","ambiguity aversion; cognitive/biases","cognition; empirical analysis; entrepreneur; probability; social behavior; theoretical study","Allinson, C.W., Chell, E., Hayes, J., Intuition and Entrepreneurial Behavior (2000) European Journal on Work and Organizational Psychology, 9 (1), pp. 31-43; Alvarez, S.A., Barney, J.B., Discovery and Creation: Alternate Theories of Entrepreneurial Action (2007) Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal, 1, pp. 11-26; Audia, P.G., Greve, H.R., Less Likely to Fail?

Heike Schirmer investigates the dynamics of partnerships between social ventures and corporations. Based on four case studies from Germany, the author shows two opposing formation processes. Means-driven partnerships, dominated by elements of effectuation, start with generalized aspirations and evolve over time. Goal-driven partnerships, dominated by elements of causation, start with pre-determined goals and follow a strategic, systematic implementation. The data also reveals that formation processes and governance mechanisms might be interlinked. © 2014 Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden.

It also discusses and argues for the aspects that lead to the requirement for a study on women-specific issues. A systematic literature review approach was applied and the member check strategy was used to minimise the author's bias. The literature involved three aspects: motivational factors for women's entry into business, the current situation of women entrepreneurs and influencing factors for the under-representation of women in the industry. The under-representation of Women Entrepreneurs in the Construction Industry (WECI) in the construction industry is caused by various factors, such as cultural background, choice of business and level of confidence. Moreover, the social structures and cultural systems that reinforce the continued subordination and marginalisation of women have major implications in their motives and involvement in business. Given the barriers faced by WECI today, there is a pressing necessity to initiate gender-sensitive empowerment programmes to enable them to succeed in their endeavours. Based on the existing literature, this paper establishes the missing link and proposes a study to formulate a conceptual framework necessary to help the public and private sector initiatives in boosting women entrepreneurship in the Tanzanian construction industry. © Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2014.","Barriers and tanzania; Construction; Entrepreneurship; Women",,"Amaratunga, D., Haigh, R., Lee, A., Elvitigala, E., Construction industry and women: A review of barriers (2009) Construction Management and Economics, 29 (3), pp. 559-571; Appelbaum, S.H., Audet, L., Miller, J.C., Gender and leadership?

Several high-tech startups fail due to inability to deal with skeptical customers, underdeveloped markets and limited resources in selling an offering that has no precedent. This paper leverages the principles of effectuation (a logic of entrepreneurial decision making under uncertainty) to explain the journey from creation to survival of high-tech startups in an emerging economy. Based on the 99tests.com case study, this paper suggests that early stage high-tech startups in emerging economies can increase their probability of survival by adopting the principles of effectuation. © 2014 IEEE.","effectuation; high-tech startups; survival","Decision making under uncertainty; Degree of uncertainty; effectuation; Emerging economies; high-tech startups; Liability of newness; Probability of survival; survival; Decision making","Birch, D.L., (1979) The Job Generation Process-Unpublished Report Prepared by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Program on Neighborhood and Regional Change for the Economic Development Administration, , U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C; Baumöl, W.J., Entrepreneurship, innovation and economic growth: The david-goliath symbiosis (2002) Journal of Entrepreneurial Finance and Business Ventures, 7 (2), pp. 1-10; Kirchhoff, B.A., Spencer, A., New high tech firm contributions to economic growth (2008) Proceedings of International Council for Small Business World Conference, 2008, , Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada; (2007) Development of High Technology Industries in Hong Kong, , Paper Ref: CSD/EC/6/2007; Mani, S., (2009) The Growth of Knowledge-intensive Entrepreneurship in India, , 1991-2007, UNU-WIDER Research Paper No. 2009/49; Athreye, S., (2010) Economic Adversity and Entrepreneurship Led Growth-Lessons from the Indian Software Sector, , UNU-WIDER Working Paper No. 2010/04; Boyacigiller, N., Adler, N.J., The parochial dinosaur: Organizational science in a global context (1991) Academy of Management Review, 16, pp. 262-290; Bruton, G.D., Rubanik, Y., Resources of the firm, Russian high-technology startups and firm growth (2002) Journal of Business Venturing, 17 (5), pp. 53-576; Sarasvathy, S.D., Causation and effectuation: Toward a theoretical shift from economic inevitability to entrepreneurial contingency (2001) The Academy of Management Review, 26 (2), pp. 243-263; Wiltbank, R., Read, S., Dew, N., Sarasvathy, S., Prediction and Control under uncertainty: Outcomes in angel investing (2009) Journal of Business Venturing, 24, pp. 116-133; Gabrielsson, P., Gabrielsson, M., A dynamic model of growth phases and survival in international business-to-business new ventures: The moderating effect of decision-making logic (2013) Industrial Marketing Management, , In Press; Garonne, C., Davidsson, P., Do strategy choices matter for nascent firms?

Entrepreneurship literature suggests that learning from diverse perspectives in teams can contribute to entrepreneurial action (Harper 2008; West III, 2007; Williams-Middleton, 2010), while management literature has shown that conflict in teams often negatively affects creativity (Jehn et al., 2010). Recent research streams suggest that entrepreneurial learning might be better understood by applying an effectual logic perspective, instead of causal logic (Sarasvathy and Venkataraman, 2011). This causes us to question whether conflict is experienced similarly in entrepreneurial versus managerial teams. We suggest negative consequences of team conflict found in management literature may be due to the causal logic underlying this literature, and thus not readily applicable to entrepreneurial learning. Through exploring relationships between team work, team conflict, and effectuation, we propose that positive learning outcomes can emerge from experience of team conflict within an effectual and uncertain problem space. © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Conflict; Creativity; Education; Effectuation; Entrepreneurship; Learning; Logic; Teams",,"Aldrich, H.E., Carter, N.M., Ruef, M., Kim, P.H., Hampered by homophily?

Project SD strategy is the missing link between SD at the corporate level and project level. The framework draws on a literature review of concepts, definitions, and theories in strategic management, corporate sustainability, and projects. The conceptual framework presented in this book chapter has six key components. These are: (1) corporate sustainability strategy; (2) project understanding of SD and SD business case; (3) strategizing at project initiation stage; (4) project autonomy to negotiate and adapt in the project context; (5) project capability to translate corporate SD strategy to project SD strategy; and (6) project capability in stakeholder management. The premise of the framework is the compatibility of the socially constructed realities of the project and SD, as indicated in SD and project literature. The aim is to help develop new knowledge and insight into how business can integrate SD principles into core business operations such as projects from a process perspective, rather than sustainability content perspective.

For this reason, effectuation has attracted considerable research attention in the last decade. Central to Sarasvathy's effectuation are two building blocks: the science of the artificial, and the pragmatist method. Effectuation starts from the position that the future is contingent in which the essential characteristic of the future, in this view, is its unpredictability. Effectuation is based on transforming uncertainty into opportunities. Despite the widespread literature on this topic, efforts to review and analyse research on effectuation theory and practice are very limited. This literature review paper proposes a new conceptual classification scheme, in order to classify past and current developments in effectuation research. More than 120 papers published on effectuation studies from 1999 to 2011 were classified and analysed. For better effectuation-theory applications, researchers need to focus their effort on the empirical studies beside the theoretical developments, which are reached in advanced stages. Finally, this paper discusses some other future research directions.

As the environment changes and the organization development, are the brands images built by corporations and perceived by consumers consistent? Why and how should this inconsistency be resolved are the main topics of this study. This study conducted in-depth interviews with case study companies using Zaltman Metaphor Elicitation Technique (ZMET) and Brand Concept Map. The results of the study discover that the founder's image of the brand is most closely aligned with the vision at the founding of the company; it is, however, vulnerable to inertia caused by self-reinforcement. Marketing managers are more sensitive to environmental changes. Their cognition of the brand image, asides from having new ideas, is also closer to the market. Front-line staff may be far from core decision-making, but because of their interaction with consumers, despite subjective influences, they are the primary channels in which corporations communicate their brand image.

The article also points out ways decision makers react when they realize their data are inaccurate or unreliable. Lastly, it examines some options for coping more effectively with inaccurate, unreliable data. Business and political journalists generally interview people who have participated in decision making. The participants explain their goals, situations faced, and the logic behind their decisions. Likewise, research about decision making and sensemaking usually assumes managers are aware of and understand their organizations and their organizations' environments. Some studies obtain almost all of their data about decision inputs and premises from the decision makers. Other studies correlate data about firms' actions with managers' perceptions of their organizations or business environments. However, almost no research has examined the accuracy of such perceptions. © Oxford University Press 2008.
