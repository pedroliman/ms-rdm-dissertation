However, BDAC pays off for some companies but not for others. It appears that very few have achieved a big impact through big data. To address this challenge, this study proposes a BDAC model drawing on the resource-based theory (RBT) and the entanglement view of sociomaterialism. The findings show BDAC as a hierarchical model, which consists of three primary dimensions (i.e., management, technology, and talent capability) and 11 subdimensions (i.e., planning, investment, coordination, control, connectivity, compatibility, modularity, technology management knowledge, technical knowledge, business knowledge and relational knowledge). The findings from two Delphi studies and 152 online surveys of business analysts in the U.S. confirm the value of the entanglement conceptualization of the higher-order BDAC model and its impact on FPER. The results also illuminate the significant moderating impact of analytics capability–business strategy alignment on the BDAC–FPER relationship. © 2016","Big data analytics; Capabilities; Entanglement view; Hierarchical modeling","Hierarchical systems; Investments; Planning; Strategic planning; Business analysts; Business knowledge; Capabilities; Data analytics; Entanglement view; Hierarchical model; Resource-based theory; Technology managements; Big data",,,,,,"Abbasi, A., Sarker, S., Chiang, R.H.L., Big data research in information systems: toward an inclusive research agenda (2016) J.

Some of the major problems that hinder their full exploitation are the heterogeneity of formats, the lack of structure, the unpredictability of their content, the size of the document bases, which can quickly become huge. The collection and mining of grey literature can be applied to individual organizations or classes of organizations, thus enabling the analysis of the trends in particular fields. To this end, some techniques can be inherited from the best practices for the management of structured documents belonging to well identified categories, but something more is needed in our case. Obvious steps are: identifying sources, collecting items, cleansing and de-duplicating contents, assigning unique and persistent identifiers, adding metadata and augmenting the information using other sources. These phases are common to all digital libraries but further steps are required, in our opinion, in the case of grey literature in order to build document bases of value. In particular, we think that an iterative approach would be the most suitable in this context, one including an assessment of what has been collected in order to identify possible gaps and start over with the collection phase. We think that big data technologies, together with information retrieval and data and text mining techniques, will play a key role in this sector. This “bag of tools” will certainly facilitate the management, browsing and exploitation of large document bases that belong not only to a single organisation but also, for example, to a large number of organizations working in a particular sector. This on the one hand opens new scenarios regarding the type of information that can be extracted, but on the other hand introduces new problems regarding the homogenization of contents, formats and metadata, and additional issues related to quality control and confidentiality protection. We believe that in this context the incremental-iterative approach would help address, gradually and based on real cases, the problems mentioned above. In this paper we describe the process that, in our opinion, should be put in place and a high level ICT architecture for its dematerialization, along with the technologies that could be leveraged for its implementation. © 2016, GreyNet.

Nowadays, nearly every aspect of the modern society is impacted by Big Data, involving medical, health care, business, management and government. It has been receiving growing attention of researches from many disciplines including natural sciences, life sciences, engineering and even art & humanities. It also leads to new research paradigms and ways of thinking on the path of development. Lots of developed and under-developing tools improve our ability to make more felicitous decisions than what we have made ever before. This paper presents an overview on Big Data including four issues, namely: (i) concepts, characteristics and processing paradigms of Big Data; (ii) the state-of-the-art techniques for decision making in Big Data; (iii) felicitous decision making applications of Big Data in social science; and (iv) the current challenges of Big Data as well as possible future directions. © 2016","Big Data; Computational social science; Data analysis; Data deluge; Data-intensive applications; Decision making","Behavioral research; Data reduction; Decision making; Social sciences; Computational social science; Data deluge; Data-intensive application; Large volumes; Life-sciences; Possible futures; State-of-the-art techniques; Ways of thinking; Big data",,,,,"61273209, NSFC, National Natural Science Foundation of China; 71571123, NSFC, National Natural Science Foundation of China","van der Aalst, W., Damiani, E., Processes meet big data: connecting data science with process science (2015) IEEE Trans.

This approach locates the throughput bottleneck of manufacturing systems based on indicators derived from measured machine performance metrics. However, the variability in manufacturing systems may affect the quality of bottleneck indicators, leading to possible inaccurate detection results. This paper presents a statistical framework (SF) to decrease the data-driven detection inaccuracy caused by system variability. Using several statistical tools as building blocks, the proposed SF is able to analyse the logical conditions under which a machine is detected as the bottleneck, and rejects the proposal of bottleneck when no sufficient statistical evidence is collected. A full factorial design experiment is used to study the parameter effects of the SF, and to calibrate the SF. The proposed SF was numerically verified to be effective in decreasing the wrong bottleneck detection rate in serial production lines. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","bottleneck; data driven; manufacturing systems","Manufacture; Statistical mechanics; bottleneck; Bottleneck detection; Bottleneck identifications; Data driven; Full factorial design; Serial production line; Statistical evidence; Statistical framework; Quality control",,,,,,"Bartels, R., The Rank Version of Von Neumann’s Ratio Test for Randomness (1982) Journal of the American Statistical Association, 77 (377), pp. 40-46; Benjamini, Y., Hochberg, Y., Controlling the False Discovery Rate: A Practical and Powerful Approach to Multiple Testing (1995) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

The ability to profile trainees using serious games can yield new analytics and insights towards training and learning performance improvement, including the identification of weaknesses or potential training needs in the players towards adaptive training, and the creation of new diagnostics for prescriptive training, retraining, and remediation. Similarity measures of players' in-game course of actions (COAs) have been shown to be a viable approach in differentiating novices from experts in serious games. In this study, we examined and compared several popular similarity measures to see if any measure, or combination of measures, would be viable in differentiating players based on their GAD profiles in serious games. Our findings revealed that similarity measures, while significant in their predicting abilities individually, could gain more strength from one another in combination. More research is needed to create or develop new metrics and methods for players’ action and behavioral profiling in Serious Games Analytics. © 2016","Decision-making profiles; Gameplay Action-Decision; Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA); Serious games analytics; Similarity measures","Discriminant analysis; Least squares approximations; Adaptive training; Course of action; Gameplay; Learning performance; Partial least squares discriminant analyses (PLSDA); Serious games; Similarity measure; Training needs; Decision making; consensus development; decision making; discriminant analysis; human; partial least squares regression",,,,,,"Bajusz, D., Rácz, A., Héberger, K., Why is Tanimoto index an appropriate choice for fingerprint-based similarity calculations?

Different from the traditional non-reference media restoration strategies, a big reference image set is adopted to provide the references and predictions of different popular prior models and accordingly guide the further prior collaboration. With these cues, the collaboration of multi-prior models is mathematically formulated as a ridge regression problem in this paper. Due to the computation complexity of dealing big reference data, scatter-matrix-based KRR is proposed which can achieve high accuracy and low complexity in big data related decision making task. Specifically, an iterative pursuit is proposed to obtain further refined and robust estimation. Five popular prior methods are applied to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-prior models collaboration. Compared with the traditional restoration strategies, the proposed framework improves the restoration performance significantly and provides a reasonable method for the relative exploration of big data driven decision making. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Big data; Data driven; Image restoration; Prior models","Complex networks; Decision making; Image reconstruction; Iterative methods; Regression analysis; Restoration; Collaboration framework; Computation complexity; Data driven; Data driven decision; Multi-prior models; Restoration strategies; Robust estimation; Social network services; Big data",,,,,,"Afonso, M.V., Bioucas-Dias, J.M., Figueiredo, M.A., Fast image recovery using variable splitting and constrained optimization (2010) IEEE Trans Image Process, 19 (9), pp. 2345-2356; Aharon, M., Elad, M., Bruckstein, A., K-svd: an algorithm for designing overcomplete dictionaries for sparse representation (2006) IEEE Trans Signal Process, 54 (11), pp. 4311-4322; Beck, A., Teboulle, M., Fast gradient-based algorithms for constrained total variation image denoising and deblurring problems (2009) IEEE Trans Image Process, 18 (11), pp. 2419-2434; Bioucas-Dias, J.M., Figueiredo, M.A., A new twist: two-step iterative shrinkage/thresholding algorithms for image restoration (2007) IEEE Trans Image Process, 16 (12), pp. 2992-3004; Buades, A., Coll, B., Morel, J.M., Image enhancement by non-local reverse heat equation (2006) CMLA Technical Report, p. 22; Candès, E., Romberg, J., Tao, T., Robust uncertainty principles: exact signal reconstruction from highly incomplete frequency information (2006) IEEE Trans Inf Theory, 52 (2), pp. 489-509; Chan, R., Dong, Y., Hintermuller, M., An efficient two-phase L1-TV method for restoring blurred images with impulse noise (2010) IEEE Trans Image Process, 19 (7), pp. 1731-1739; Chen, C., Huang, J., Compressive sensing mri with wavelet tree sparsity.

In order to improve the sustainability of manufacturing equipment services in job shop, this paper presents a multi-objective joint model of energy consumption and production efficiency. The model is related to multi-conditions of manufacturing equipment services. The conditions are monitored in real-time to drive a multi-objective dynamic optimized scheduling of manufacturing services. In order to solve the multi-objective problem, an enhanced Pareto-based bees algorithm (EPBA) is proposed. In order to ensure the variety of population, to prevent the premature convergence, and to improve the searching speed, several key technologies are utilized such as variable neighborhood searching, mutation and crossover operation, fast non-dominated ranking, critical path local search, archive Pareto set, critical path taboo set, etc. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated and shows better performance in static and dynamic scenarios compared with the existing optimization algorithms. © 2016 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Bees algorithm; Manufacturing equipment service; Optimized scheduling; Perception data-driven; Sustainable manufacturing","Algorithms; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Equipment; Job shop scheduling; Manufacture; Scheduling; Bees algorithms; Data driven; Manufacturing equipment; Optimized scheduling; Sustainable manufacturing; Optimization",,,,,"51305319, NSFC, National Natural Science Foundation of China; EP/N018524/1, EPSRC, Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Bruntland, G.H., Report of the world commission on environment and development: our common future (1987), http://www.un-documents.net/wced-ocf.htm, [accessed 05.08.15]Schipper, M., Energy-related carbon dioxide emissions in US manufacturing (2006) Energy Inf Adm, pp. 8-10; Li, B.-H., Zhang, L., Wang, S.-L., Tao, F., Cao, J., Jiang, X., Cloud manufacturing: a new service-oriented networked manufacturing model (2010) Comput Integr Manuf Syst, 16, pp. 1-7; Xu, X., From cloud computing to cloud manufacturing (2012) Robot Comput-Integr Manuf, 28, pp. 75-86; Zhang, L., Luo, Y., Tao, F., Li, B.H., Ren, L., Zhang, X., Cloud manufacturing: a new manufacturing paradigm (2013) Enterp Inf Syst, 8, pp. 167-187; Tao, F., Zhang, L., Venkatesh, V.C., Luo, Y., Cheng, Y., Cloud manufacturing: a computing and service-oriented manufacturing model (2011) Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of Engineering Manufacture; Tao, F., Zhang, L., Liu, Y., Cheng, Y., Wang, L., Xu, X., Manufacturing service management in cloud manufacturing: overview and future research directions (2015) J Manuf Sci Eng, 137, p. 040912; Xu, W., Yao, B., Fang, Y., Xu, W., Liu, Q., Zhou, Z., Service-oriented sustainable manufacturing: framework and methodologies (2014) Proceedings of the 2014 International Conference on Innovative Design and Manufacturing (ICIDM), IEEE, pp. 305-310; He, Y., Liu, B., Zhang, X., Gao, H., Liu, X., A modeling method of task-oriented energy consumption for machining manufacturing system (2012) J Clean Prod, 23, pp. 167-174; Fang, K., Uhan, N., Zhao, F., Sutherland, J., A new shop scheduling approach in support of sustainable manufacturing (2011) Glocalized solutions for sustainability in manufacturing, pp. 305-310. , J.

In this regard, it explores new potentials through the application of predictive analytics to big data while focusing on production planning and control in the context of the process manufacturing industry. This type of industry is an adequate application domain for the conceived concept, since it features several characteristics that are opposed to conventional industries such as assembling ones. These specifics include divergent and cyclic material flows, high diversity in end products’ qualities, as well as non-linear production processes that are not fully controllable. Based on a case study of a German steel producing company – a typical example of the process industry – the work at hand outlines which data becomes available when using state-of-the-art sensor technology and thus providing the required basis to realize the proposed concept. However, a consideration of the data size reveals that dedicated methods of big data analytics are required to tap the full potential of this data. Consequently, the paper derives seven requirements that need to be addressed for a successful implementation of the concept. Additionally, the paper proposes a generic architecture of prescriptive enterprise systems. This architecture comprises five building blocks of a system that is capable to detect complex event patterns within a multi-sensor environment, to correlate them with historical data and to calculate predictions that are finally used to recommend the best course of action during process execution in order to minimize or maximize certain key performance indicators. © 2015, Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden.","Big data; Complex event processing; Event-driven business process management; Predictive analytics; Prescriptive analytics; Process industry",,,,,,,"Aggarwal, C., An introduction to sensor data analytics (2012) Managing and mining sensor data, pp. 1-8. , Aggarwal C, (ed), Springer, New York; Akerkar, B., Advanced data analytics for business (2013) Big data computing, pp. 373-397. , Akerkar B, (ed), CRC Press, Boca Raton; Allwood, J., Cullen, J., (2012) Sustainable materials with both eyes open, , UIT Cambridge, Cambridge; Benbasat, I., Goldstein, D., Mead, M., The case research strategy in studies of information systems (1987) MIS Q, 11 (3), pp. 369-386; (2012) Big Data im Praxiseinsatz – Szenarien, Beispiele, , Effekte, BITKOM, Berlin; Bruns, R., Dunkel, J., (2010) Event-Driven Architecture, , Springer, Berlin; Buhl, H., Röglinger, M., Moser, F., Heidemann, J., Big data.

Weakness in managing the implementation strategy and the performance can result a massive impact to people and nation. Therefore, integration of BI and BDA are necessity to assist decision makers to increase efficiency in public services. However, preliminary study had identified limited implementation of BI and business analytics with organisation performance management (OPM) that led to inefficient performance in management practice. At the same time, large amount of data from various resources have headed to the emergent of big data analytics. Therefore, this research is proposed with the aim to develop an integrated framework of business intelligence and big data analytics (BI-BDA) for OPM. To achieve this goal, elements and sub elements of integrated BI-BDA and OPM implementation will be identified which focuses on big data analytics. Main outcome from this research is the new integrated framework of BI and BDA (BI-BDA) for OPM in public sector. The proposed framework is valuable for the practitioners as well as the stakeholders to ensure the OPM system to be more effective and dynamic. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers.

Hereby the complexity of these systems can be managed and an efficient operation can be reached. © 2016 Walter de Gruyter Berlin/Boston.","bottleneck detection; flexible manufacturing system; managing complexity; managing variability; Smart Data",,,,,,,"Spath, D., Ganschar, O., Gerlach, S., Hämmerle, M., Krause, T., Schlund, S., (2013) Produktionsarbeit der Zukunft-Industrie 4.0.

The founders and the managers of nonprofits look forward to information and communication technologies (ICTs) not only to aid in organizational effectiveness, but also to aid in societal missions. This paper analyzes the attitude of nonprofit organizations toward the new ICTs such as social media, mobility, analytics and cloud computing (SMAC). We followed a mixed methods sequential explanatory strategy, in which two data collection phases were employed. The quantitative phase following the qualitative phase investigated the SMAC adoption and how the adoption of SMAC helped the organizations meet their missions. Overall, the adoption of SMAC showed immediate positive outcomes such as organizational effectiveness and bridging digital divide. © 2015 Commonwealth Secretariat.","case study; information and communication technologies; mobility; nonprofit organization; sequential mixed-method study; social media; unified theory of acceptance and use of technology",,,,,,,"Avgerou, C., The significance of context in information systems and organizational change (2001) Information Systems Journal, 11 (1), pp. 43-63; Ayanso, A., Cho, D.I., Lertwachara, K., The digital divide: Global and regional ICT leaders and followers (2010) Information Technology for Development, 16 (4), pp. 304-319; Bach, J., Stark, D., Link, search, interact the co-evolution of NGOs and interactive technology (2004) Theory, Culture & Society, 21 (3), pp. 101-117; Bacon, N., Hoque, K., HRM in the SME sector: Valuable employees and coercive networks (2005) The International Journal of Human Resource Management, 16 (11), pp. 1976-1999; Bagozzi, R.P., Yi, Y., Specification, evaluation, and interpretation of structural equation models (2012) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 40 (1), pp. 8-34; Bennett, R., Market orientation among small to medium sized UK charitable organisations: Implications for fund-raising performance (1998) Journal of Nonprofit & Public Sector Marketing, 6 (1), pp. 31-45; Birkholz, J., (2008) Fundraising analytics: Using data to guide strategy, , Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Son; Bortree, D.S., Seltzer, T., Dialogic strategies and outcomes: An analysis of environmental advocacy groups’ Facebook profiles (2009) Public Relations Review, 35 (3), pp. 317-319; Briones, R.L., Kuch, B., Liu, B.F., Jin, Y., Keeping up with the digital age: How the American Red Cross uses social media to build relationships (2011) Public Relations Review, 37 (1), pp. 37-43; Burt, E., Taylor, J.A., Information and communication technologies: Reshaping voluntary organizations?

This paper presents the results of empirical research conducted to investigate these complex links. The empirical data was drawn from 81 companies of different sectors in Brazil. Data analysis was mainly based on path analysis with structural equation modeling. The findings of this study indicate that analytical orientation can leverage process innovation. Moreover, information quality is somehow a more valuable resource to analytical orientation than information technology, and that analytical capabilities, especially analytical leadership, were proven to be more important to sustain analytical orientation than companies' analytical resources. Another important result, also with considerable repercussion in future research on the theme, was the predictive relevance of analytical capabilities for analytical orientation. This was much higher than the predictive relevance shown by analytical resources.

However, determining and demonstrating the benefit to emergency management information systems (EMIS) users has yet been realised. EMIS are critical to navigating a complex network of disparate IS used for real time, coordinated decision-making among agencies. Two significant challenges to incorporating BD analytical, visual, and predictive capabilities are mutual acceptance and system integration. This paper looks at the underlying principles of organisational mindfulness (OM) demonstrated in the convergence of EM processes, systems, and organisations in decision-making. The investigation proposes a design science research in information systems (DSRIS) approach to build an IS artefact for EMIS evaluation. Critical immediacy of information and decisions require adherence to processes which build capabilities to support EMIS users. This adds a layer of complexity to ISDT for EMIS, yet may equally lead to broader BD acceptance and integration. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","big data; design science research; Emergency management; information systems; organisational mindfulness","Big data; Civil defense; Complex networks; Coordination reactions; Design; Disasters; Information management; Information systems; Risk management; Coordinated decision; Design-science researches; Emergency management; Governmental agency; Organisational; Predictive capabilities; System integration; Underlying principles; Decision making",,,,,,"Belardo, S., Karwan, K.R., Wallace, W., An investigation of system design considerations for emergency management decision support (1984) IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, 14, pp. 795-804. , SMC; Butler, B.S., Gray, P.H., Reliability, mindfulness, and information systems (2006) MIS Quaterly, 30, pp. 211-224. , http://www.butlercommonplace.org/thoughts/images/temp/d/d3/20070630112724!ButlerGray2006.pdf; Curnin, S., A theoretical framework for negotiating the path of emergency management multi-agency coordination (2015) Applied Ergonomics, 47, pp. 300-307. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2014.10.014; Donovan, A., BYTE : Big data and social media mining in crisis and emergency management (2015) Open Source Intelligence Conference; Dorasamy, M., Raman, M., Kaliannan, M., Knowledge management systems in support of disasters management: A two decade review (2013) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 80, pp. 1834-1853. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2012.12.008; Fiol, C.M., O’Connor, E.J., Waking up!

Business scholars have increasingly turned their attention to the impact of this emerging phenomenon. Despite the rise in attention, our understanding of what big data is and what it means for organizations and institutional actors remains uncertain. In this study, we conduct a systematic review on ""big data"" across business scholarship over the past six years (2009-2014). We analyzed 219 peer-reviewed academic papers from 152 journals from the most comprehensive business literature database. We conducted the systematic review both quantitatively and qualitatively using the data analysis software NVivo10. Our results reveal several key insights about the scholarly investigation of big data, including its top benefits and challenges. Overall, we found that big data remains a fragmented, early-stage domain of research in terms of theoretical grounding, methodological diversity and empirically oriented work. These challenges serve to improve our understanding of the state of big data in contemporary research, and to further prompt scholars and decision-makers to advance future research in the most productive manner. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this paper is to analyse different associated risks using situation-actor-process, learnings-actions-performance (SAP-LAP) model and build mitigation strategies for the adoption. Also the risks are ranked using the interactive ranking process (IRP) methodology and the dominating matrix provides insight to the actions and actors that need attention to improve the processes and performance. Design/methodology/approach – A case study of a TSP (X1) was analysed through close interactions with experts within the company and externals involved in setting up the BA practice in X1. Using the SAP-LAP framework risks were identified and then the IRP was used to rank the actors w.r.t performance and actions w.r.t processes. Findings – X1 has taken initiatives for setting up the BA practice in order to improve the profitability and customer experience through data insights. The suggested conceptual SAP-LAP model helps to address risk mitigation strategies for its adoption and the IRP frameworks helps in understanding the prioritisation matrix (using the ranking) to be considered to mitigate the risks. Research limitations/implications – The IRP framework is limited to certain relationships between actors, w.r.t processes and actions w.r.t performance for the prioritisation matrix of identified risks. This has scope to be further expanded to other relationships and therefore refining the findings. Also this approach could be used to study other industries too. Practical implications – SAP-LAP model identifies the risks in adopting the BA practice in a TSP. The synthesis of SAP leads to LAP, which bridges the gap by suggesting improvement actions based on the learning from the present situation, actors and processes. IRP provides the prioritisation matrix for mitigating the risks by identifying the dominating factors. Originality/value – BA practice plays a dominant role in a TSP. An approach to study the risks of its adoption using the SAP-LAP and IRP framework bridges the gap between the academic and corporate world. This paper is very relevant to managers involved in setting up a BA practice. For the academic, use of research model validates the identification of risks that are recognised in the corporate world and prioritising the risks that need to be addressed. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Adoption;

This study presents a data-based procedure for systematic yield enhancements in drug product manufacturing, based on four steps. On the first step, production is reviewed to select relevant loss causes, which are assessed on the second step deductively with the goal of assigning measurable parameters. Descriptive Statistical Modelling of loss causes is then performed on the third step, enabling model-based enhancements of processes on the fourth step or, if necessary, a loop-back review of a given loss cause. An industrial case study was performed on production data of 88 batches and demonstrated the applicability of the procedure by prioritizing relevant loss causes, reducing required sample quantities by up to 8% and a cosmetic defect by about 70% by a process change. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Biologics; Decision-making; Industrial case study; Multivariate data analysis; Sterile drug product manufacturing","Decision making; Multivariant analysis; Batch production process; Biologics; Industrial case study; Measurable parameters; Multivariate data analysis; Product manufacturing; Research productivity; Statistical modelling; Manufacture",,,,,,"Casola, G., Yoshikawa, S., Nakanishi, H., Hirao, M., Sugiyama, H., Systematic retrofitting methodology for pharmaceutical drug purification processes (2016) Comput Chem Eng, 80, pp. 177-188; Dassau, E., Zadok, I., Lewin, D., Combining six-sigma with integrated design and control for yield enhancement in bioprocessing (2006) Ind Eng Chem Res, 45, pp. 8299-8309; Eberle, L., Sugiyama, H., Papadokonstantakis, S., Graser, A., Schmidt, R., Hungerbuhler, K., Data-based tiered approach for improving pharmaceutical batch production processes (2014) Comput Aided Chem Eng, 33, pp. 463-468; Eberle, L., Sugiyama, H., Schmidt, R., Improving production lead time of pharmaceutical production processes using Monte Carlo simulation (2014) Comput Chem Eng, 68, pp. 255-263; Eberle, L., Sugiyama, H., Papadokonstantakis, S., Graser, A., Schmidt, R., Hungerbuhler, K., Improving pharmaceutical batch production processes with data-based tiered approach (2015) Comput Aided Chem Eng, 34, pp. 1967-1972; Eriksson, L., Johansson, E., Kettaneh-Wold, H., Trygg, J., Wikström, C., Wold, S., (2006) Multi- and megavariate data analysis, , Umetrics AB, Umea; Facco, P., Largoni, M., Tomba, E., Bezzo, F., Barolo, M., Transfer of process monitoring models between plants: batch systems (2014) Chem Eng Res Des, 92, pp. 273-284; Filho, E., Oliveira, A., Melo, J., Lira, D., Peixoto, M., Rolim, F., Analysis of yield behavior in captopril tablet production through statistical process control (2013) Lat Am J Pharm, 32, pp. 498-506; García-Muñoz, S., Two novel methods to analyze the combined effect of multiple raw-materials and processing conditions on the product's final attributes: JRPLS and TPLS (2014) Chemometr Intell Lab, 133, pp. 49-62; García-Muñoz, S., Padovani, V., Mercado, J., A computer aided optimal inventory selection system for continuous quality improvement in drug product manufacture (2014) Comput Chem Eng, 60, pp. 396-402; García-Muñoz, S., Mercado, J., Optimal selection of raw materials for pharmaceutical drug product design and manufacture using mixed integer nonlinear programming and multivariate latent variable regression models (2013) Ind Eng Chem Res, 52, pp. 5934-5942; Gastwirth, J., Gel, Y., Miao, W., The impact of Levene's test of equality of variances on statistical theory and practice (2009) Stat Sci, 24, pp. 343-360; Gernaey, K., Cervera-Padrell, A., Woodley, J., Development of continuous pharmaceutical production processes supported by process systems engineering methods and tools (2012) Future Med Chem, 4, pp. 1371-1374; Glenberg, A., Andrzejewski, M., (2008) Learning from data: an introduction to statistical reasoning, , Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, New York; González-Martínez, J., Camacho, J., Ferrer, A., Bilinear modeling of batch processes.

The article argues that arts bodies have been slower than some business sectors to enter the data sphere and to contribute to the key debates even though many arts organisations have been developing data systems as a means of responding to the demands of funding bodies for more concrete measurement of impact. The article tests this hypothesis by examining the outcomes of a major NESTA/ACE/AHRC-funded project which applied ethnographic method to analyse the use of data by three major arts bodies operating in London, a project which built on the arguments forwarded in a previous NESTA document, Counting what counts (NESTA 2013). The project, managed by the Audience Agency, on which the present author was principal researcher, was delivered over 12 months from August 2014 to August 2015. The article outlines the methodology, and highlights the emergence of a new ethnographic form, “thick data” grounded in data theory and practice. This form is then used to illuminate some of the practices used by large arts organisations to handle audience data, and to develop inclusive and comprehensive future programming strategies. A range of embedded practices are discussed and examined illustrating the various strategies used by the partner organisations to address key data issues and problems. From this detailed analysis, the article then outlines a number of models for the organisation of data within arts institutions. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Big Data; culture; ethnography; symbolic creativity; technology; Thick data",,,,,,,"Lilley, A., Moore, P., (2013) Counting what counts, , London: NESTA/Arts Council England; Madsbjerg, C., Rasmussen, M., (2014), http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304256404579449254114659882, The power of big data in the Wall Street Journal.

The new emerged technologies such as cloud computing and internet of things are analyzed and the bottlenecks faced by enterprises in manufacturing big data analytics are investigated. Scientific workflow technology as a method to solve the problems is introduced and an architecture of scientific workflow management system based on cloud manufacturing service platform is proposed. The functions of each layer in the architecture are described in detail and implemented with an existing workflow system as a case study. The workflow scheduling algorithm is the key issue of management system, and the related work is reviewed. This paper takes the general problems of existing algorithms as the motivation to propose a novel scheduling algorithm called MP (max percentages) algorithm.

The calculations and analyses for hydrostatic bearings are always laborious because of the involvement of several disciplines such as elastic mechanics, hydromechanics, thermodynamics, and other factors in the design. It is well known that large data and cloud technology are capable of processing and transmission of hydrostatic system studies. In this work, a cloud manufacture model is presented to provide big data storage, transmission, and processing platform for designers, manufacturers, and users of hydrostatic bearings. All participants involved in the manufacturing were linked together by timely information communication in order to ensure that the customized products met with the actual conditions in the cloud server. Based on the actual requirements of the user, the carrying capacity of hydrostatic system was analyzed by a designer using finite difference method and the results were sent to the manufacturer for machining of components. The monitored data from the consumer could be fed back to the designer for performance evaluation through the cloud server. It was found that customized manufacturing tasks could be finished more reliably and efficiently if all participants exchanged the data through cloud platform in real time. © 2015, Springer-Verlag London.","Big data;

With the IoT technologies such as radio frequency identification (RFID) implemented in manufacturing sites, enormous data will be generated. Such data are so complex, abstract, and variable so that it is difficult to make full use of the data which carry great myriad of useful information and knowledge. This paper presents a visualization approach for the RFID-enabled shopfloor logistics Big Data from Cloud Manufacturing. An innovative RFID-Cuboid model is used for reconstructing the RFID raw data given the production logic and time series. Several contributions are highlighted. Firstly, a possible approach to integrate IoT and Cloud Manufacturing is introduced to upgrade and transform the traditional industry for an intelligent future. Secondly, an RFID-Cuboid model is proposed by using the production logic and time stamps to chain the RFID data so that the data could be interpreted. Thirdly, a real-life case is reported to show the feasibility and practicality of the proposed visualization approach to help different end-users to ease their daily operations. Lessons and insights from this case are meaningful for the implementation of IoT-enabled Cloud Manufacturing and Big Data analytics in industry field. © 2015, Springer-Verlag London.","Big Data visualization;

This paper aims at illustrating the role of big data analytics in supporting world-class sustainable manufacturing (WCSM). Using an extensive literature review to identify different factors that enable the achievement of WCSM through BD and 405 usable responses from senior managers gathered through social networking sites (SNS), we propose a conceptual framework using constructs obtained using reduction of gathered data that summarizes this role; test this framework using data which is heterogeneous, diverse, voluminous, and possess high velocity; and highlight the importance for academia and practice. Finally, we conclude our research findings and further outlined future research directions. © 2015, Springer-Verlag London.","Big data; Confirmatory factor analysis; Social networking site; Sustainable manufacturing; World class sustainable manufacturing","Engineering education; Factor analysis; Manufacture; Social networking (online); Websites; Conceptual frameworks; Confirmatory factor analysis; Data analytics; Future research directions; Literature reviews; Senior managers; Social networking sites; Sustainable manufacturing; Big data",,,,,,"Fawcett, S.E., Waller, M.A., Supply chain game changers—mega, nano, and virtual trends—and forces that impede supply chain design (ie, building a winning team) (2014) J Bus Logist, 35 (3), pp. 157-164; The role of big data and analytics in the developing world.

Given this as a background, the service-oriented business models based on requests by upper layers, which have been around for some time, are expected to develop further and faster. To support such business models, Fujitsu has developed a real-time full capture system compatible with the 200 Gbps bandwidth, leveraging the Company's networking and big data analysis technologies. The system is designed to capture and analyze a large volume of highspeed data using virtual platforms. This paper briefly looks at user expectations for virtual platform services and challenges with regards to providing such services. Then it describes the characteristics of the developed system.",,"Data handling; Embedded systems; Information analysis; Internet of things; Business models; Capture system; High-speed data; Internet of thing (IOT); Machine-to-machine communications; Service Oriented; User expectations; Virtual platform; Big data",,,,,,,,,,"Fujitsu Ltd",,,,,00162523,,FUSTA,,"English","Fujitsu Sci Tech J",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964226625

It becomes computationally inaccurate to analyze such big data for decision making systems. Methods/Analysis: Hadoop, which is a working model based on the Map-Reduce framework with efficient computation and processing of Big Data. Findings: Most of the traditional classification algorithms have issues such as class imbalance and dimension reduction on Big Data. However, a large part of the data produced today are incomplete and inaccurate, so large organizations prefer relational databases to store their information, but the user query processing speed is very low. Unlike existing solutions that require a prior knowledge of classification accuracy for various types of data characteristics, which is impossible to obtain in practice. Applications/Improvement: In this paper, we have given a compared proposed model to different big data feature selection and classification models along with advantages and limitations.","Big data; Decision tree; Feature selection; Hadoop; Mapreduce",,,,,,,"Qian, J., Lv, P., Yue, X., Liu, C., Jing, Z., Hierarchical attribute reduction algorithms for big data using MapReduce (2015) Knowledge-Based Systems, 73, pp. 18-31; Leung, C.K., Jiang, F., A data science solution for mining interesting patterns from uncertain big data (2014) In 2014 IEEE 4th International Conference on Big Data and Cloud Computing, pp. 235-242. , Sydney, NSW; Fayed, H.A., Atiya, A.F., A Novel template reduction approach for the-nearest neighbor method (2009) IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 20 (5), pp. 890-896; Kolias, V., Kolias, C., Anagnostopoulos, I., Kayafas, E., Rule MR: Classification rule discovery with MapReduce (2014) In 2014 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data), pp. 20-28. , Washington: DC; Wang, R., He, Y.L., Chow, C.Y., Ou, F.F., Zhang, J., Learning ELM-tree from big data based on uncertainty reduction (2015) Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 258, pp. 79-100; Del Río, S., López, V., Benítez, J.M., Herrera, F., On the use of MapReduce for imbalanced big data using random forest (2014) Information Sciences, 285, pp. 112-137. , Nov; Feng, Q., Miao, D., Cheng, Y., Hierarchical decision rules mining (2010) Expert systems with applications, 37 (3), pp. 2081-2091. , Mar; Triguero, I., Peralta, D., Bacardit, J., García, S., Herrera, F., MRPR: a MapReduce solution for prototype reduction in big data classification (2015) Neurocomputing, 150, pp. 331-345. , Feb; Noh, K.S., Lee, D.S., Bigdata Platform Design and Implementation Model (2015) Indian Journal of Science and Technology, 8 (18), pp. 1-8",,,,"Indian Society for Education and Environment",,,,,09746846,,,,"English","Indian J.

(1984) introduce a theory of party organizational strength, arguing that the strongest parties exhibit both organizational complexity and programmatic capacity. In the present era, organizational complexity and programmatic capacity still emerge as the primary dimensions of party organizational strength, but this research demonstrates the importance of new indicators of party technological capacity to our understanding of party effectiveness in the early 21st century. In particular, parties that hire technologically-oriented staff are best equipped to carry out party programmatic activities, as they have the capacity to conduct voter mobilization programs and sophisticated data analytics in an online environment. Using data from a 2011 survey of the state party organizations in the US, this research shows that party organizational strength and party technological capacity are interrelated and overlapping concepts and are essential to understanding the parties’ programmatic and voter outreach capabilities. © 2015, The Author(s) 2015.","campaign activity; party change/adaptation; political parties; structural complexity; using the Internet",,,,,,,"(1986) The Transformation in American Politics: Implications for Federalism, , Report, U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, Washington, DC:; Aldrich, J.H., (1995) Why Parties?

Especially free-floating carsharing, which allows customers to leave their car anywhere within the operator's business area, provides users with flexibility, and complements public transportation. We present a novel method that provides strategic and operational decision support to companies maneuvering this competitive and constantly changing market environment. Using an extensive set of customer data in a zero-inflated regression model, we explain spatial variation in carsharing activity through the proximity of particular points of interests, such as movie theaters and airports. As an application case, as well as a validation of the model, we use the resulting indicators to predict the number of rentals before an expansion of the business area and compare it to the actual demand post-expansion. We find that our approach correctly identifies areas with a high carsharing activity and can be easily adapted to other cities. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Data analytics; Decision support; Free-floating carsharing;

The effective use of data requires that teachers develop the knowledge and skills to analyze and use data to improve instruction. The purpose of this article is to examine teachers’ capacity for and beliefs about data use. These issues are examined through a review of research in the past decade. We find that teachers’ beliefs about and capacity for data use are often not connected within the literature or in practice, but we argue they are the heart of the connection between data and instructional change. Teachers’ capacity to use data and their beliefs about data use are shaped within their professional communities, in training sessions, and in their interactions with coaches, consultants, and principals. However, efforts to develop teachers’ capacity for data use often fall short of their goals. Correspondingly, teachers have varied beliefs about data use, and some feel they lack the ability to use data to inform instruction. In order to be more successful, capacity building should directly address teachers’ beliefs, and data use must be decoupled from external accountability demands and involve a variety of information on student learning. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Data-driven decision making; Teacher beliefs; Teacher capacity",,,,,,,"Bambrick-Santoyo, P., (2010) Driven by data: A practice guide to improve instruction, , Jossey Bass Publishers, San Francisco; Bernhardt, V., (2013) Data analysis for continuous improvement, , Routledge, New York; Blanc, S., Christman, J.B., Liu, R., Mitchell, C., Travers, E., Bulkley, K.E., Learning to learn from data: Benchmarks and instructional communities (2010) Peabody Journal of Education, 85 (2), pp. 205-225; Bocala, C., Boudett, K.P., Teaching educators habits of mind for using data wisely (2015) Teachers College Record, 117 (4), pp. 1-20; Brookhart, S.M., Educational assessment knowledge and skills for teachers (2011) Educational Measurement: Issues and Practice, 30 (1), pp. 3-12; Brown, G.T., Lake, R., Matters, G., Queensland teachers’ conceptions of assessment: The impact of policy priorities on teacher attitudes (2011) Teaching and Teacher Education, 27 (1), pp. 210-220; Bruning, R., Schraw, G., Ronning, R., (1999) Cognitive psychology and instruction, , Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ; Cho, V., Wayman, J., District efforts for data use and computer data systems: The role of sensemaking in system use and implementation (2014) Teachers College Record, 116, p. 020306; Christman, J.B., Neild, R.C., Bulkley, K., Blanc, S., Liu, R., Mitchell, C., Travers, E., Making the most of interim assessment data (2009), http://www.researchforaction.org/wp-content/uploads/publication-photos/41/Christman_J_Making_the_Most_of_Interim_Assessment_Data.pdf, Lessons from, Philadelphia.

By providing a framework to systematically analyse DDBMs, the study provides an introduction to DDBM as a field of study. Design/methodology/approach: To develop the taxonomy of DDBMs, business model descriptions of 100 randomly chosen start-up firms were coded using a DDBM framework derived from literature, comprising six dimensions with 35 features. Subsequent application of clustering algorithms produced six different types of DDBM, validated by case studies from the study’s sample. Findings: The taxonomy derived from the research consists of six different types of DDBM among start-ups. These types are characterised by a subset of six of nine clustering variables from the DDBM framework. Practical implications: A major contribution of the paper is the designed framework, which stimulates thinking about the nature and future of DDBMs. The proposed taxonomy will help organisations to position their activities in the current DDBM landscape. Moreover, framework and taxonomy may lead to a DDBM design toolbox. Originality/value: This paper develops a basis for understanding how start-ups build business models capture value from data as a key resource, adding a business perspective to the discussion of big data. By offering the scientific community a specific framework of business model features and a subsequent taxonomy, the paper provides reference points and serves as a foundation for future studies of DDBMs. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Big data; Business model; Data-driven business model; Start-up business model",,,,,,,"Al-Debei, M., Avison, D., Developing a unified framework of the business model concept (2010) European Journal of Information Systems, 19 (3), pp. 359-376; Baden-Fuller, C., Haefliger, S., Business models and technological innovation (2013) Long Range Planning, 46 (6), pp. 419-426; Barnes, C., Blake, H., Pinder, D., (2009) Creating & Delivering Your Value Proposition.

In this drive integration of business processes and systems and improvements in information flow across organization becomes essential which is obtained by adopting Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems which acts as enabler. Effective integration of ERP with Supply Chain Management (SCM) enables sharing of information on order and shipment with multiple organizations and to better manage information, cash and product flows. Changing business environment has turned supply chains (SC) more complex as they are moving into the digital world through multiple initiatives, embracing new technologies such as big data, social media, mobile, Internet of things simultaneously. The convergence of these new technologies has finally resulted into phenomenal growth in the underlying data set not only in volume, but also in variety, veracity, velocity and value. Organizations are trying to use new forms of data to improve supply chain excellence. Big data analytics (BDA) allows to quickly combine structured data such as that in ERP, and combine them with unstructured data for analysis that could lead to increased efficiency and profitability in the SC. Purpose of this paper is to examine the potential of ERP and SCM integrated with BDA contributing to improvement in the performance of manufacturing organizations. The analysis will be beneficial to practitioners and enterprise to evaluate performance. © International Science Press.","BDA; Big data; Enterprise resource planning; ERP; SC; SCM; Supply chain management; Supply chains",,,,,,,"(2014) Big Data Analytics in Supply Chain: Hype or Here to Stay?, , http://www.accenture.com/us-en/Pages/insightglobal-operations-megatrends-big-data-analytics.aspx; Akkermans, H.A., Bogerd, P., Insead, E.Y., Insead, L.W., 'The impact of ERP Systems on Supply Chain Management.

Meanwhile, some changes of consumer behavior were analyzed in a Big Data environment. Based on these, the market demand function and the benefit model of stakeholder were built and analyzed. Findings: (1) The first finding is whether an enterprise was suitable for gaining Big Data to improve its costs, which was determined by the cost improvement coefficient; namely, it was related to the ability of excavating and using the value of Big Data. (2) Whether the supply chain was the decentralized decision-making and the centralized decision-making, the thresholds of acquisition costs on Big Data information were equal. Moreover, the maximum value that they could undertake was same. (3) Meanwhile the fact that the quantity discount contract could achieve a win-win outcome for supply chain members was proved. The discount coefficient was related to consumers' behavior preference in a Big Data environment. © 2016 Pan Liu and Shu-ping Yi.",,,,,,,,"Gantz, J., Reinsel, D., Extracting value fromchaos (2011) Idcemc2 Report; Huixin, H.X.Z., Build enterprise competitive intelligence system model based on big data (2013) Journal of Intelligence, 32 (3), pp. 37-43; Andrew, M.A., Erik, B., Big Data: The management revolution (2012) Harvard Business Review, 90 (10), pp. 68-128; Sanders, N.R., (2015) Big Data Driven Supply Chain Management, , China Renmin University Press; Liu, Z., Zhang, Q., Research overview of Big Data technology (2014) Journal of Zhejiang University, 6. , article 1; Fan, M.-Q., Ren, R.-E., Study on consumption structure of urban household based on heterogeneous preferences (2007) China Soft Science, 17 (10), pp. 37-46; Chase, Jr.C.W., (2013) Demand-Driven Forecasting: A Structured Approach to Forecasting, , JohnWiley & Sons, Hoboken, NJ, USA; (2013) BaiFenBai Things Internet. 1 Shop: Data-driven Supply Chain Model, , http://www.chinawuliu.com.cn/zhxw/201312/02/265336.shtml; Chen, J., Xiao, Y.B., New developments and research prospects in supply chain management (2011) Journal of University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, 6. , article 27; Sanders, N.R., (2014) Big Data Driven Supply Chain Management: A Framework for Implementing Analytics and Turning Information into Intelligence, , Pearson Education; Wang, L., Alexander, C.A., Big data driven supply chain management and business administration (2015) American Journal of Economics and Business Administration, 7 (2), pp. 60-67; Gantz, J., Reinsel, D., Extracting value from chaos (2011) IDC Research Report; Xue, L.L., Gang, H.G., Big data system review (2015) Science China Press, 45 (1), pp. 1-44; Gantz, J., Reinsel, D., (2007) The Digital Universe in 2020: Big Data, Bigger Digital Shadows, and Biggest Growth in the Far East, IDC IView, , IDC Analyze the Future; Pei, Z.T., Big Data coming data revolution (2012) Chinses Journal QiuXian, pp. 60-61; Lian, W.L., Ming, J.X., Innovative business models based on big data (2013) China Industrial Economics, 2, pp. 83-95; Jian, L., Hao, S., Study the competitive intelligence systemof closed-loop supply chain big data era (2014) Library and Information Service, 58 (2), pp. 96-101; Hazen, B.T., Boone, C.A., Ezell, J.D., Jones-Farmer, L.A., Data quality for data science, predictive analytics, and big data in supply chain management: An introduction to the problem and suggestions for research and applications (2014) International Journal of Production Economics, 154, pp. 72-80; Bowie, N.E., Jamal, K., Privacy rights on the internet: Selfregulation or government regulation?

Of these, maintenance decision support is vital. One widely used maintenance strategy has been selective maintenance. Most traditional selective maintenance optimisation research has focused on binary state systems, which are subject to distribution deterioration or failure. However, a majority of systems used in aerospace or industrial applications are multi-state systems with more than two states deteriorating at the same time, meaning that real-time state distribution is needed to provide more timely and effective maintenance. This paper presents a novel integrated system health management-oriented maintenance decision support methodology and framework for a multi-state system based on data mining. An aero-engine system numerical example is given to illustrate the methodology, the results of which demonstrate the significant advantages of using data mining to efficiently obtain state distribution information, and the benefits of using a robust optimal model to choose suitable strategies. This methodology, which is applicable to multi-state systems of varying sizes, has the ability to solve maintenance problems when imperfect maintenance quality is considered. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Data mining; integrated system health management; maintenance strategy; multi-state system","Aircraft engines; Decision making; Decision support systems; Deterioration; Health; Information management; Integrated control; Maintenance; Optimization; Preventive maintenance; Real time systems; Imperfect maintenance; Integrated system health managements; Maintenance decision making; Maintenance decisions; Maintenance Problem; Maintenance strategies; Multi-state system; Selective maintenance; Data mining",,,,,"2014M552375, China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","Abdelhamid, N., Ayesh, A., Thabtah, F., Phishing detection based associative classification data mining (2014) Expert Systems with Applications, 41 (13), pp. 5948-5959; Bhardwaj, B.K., Pal, S., Data mining:Aprediction for performance improvement using classification (2012) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security, 9 (4), pp. 136-140; Cassady, C.R., Pohl, E.A., Murdock, W.P., Selective maintenance modeling for industrial systems (2001) Journal of Quality in Maintenance Engineering, 7 (2), pp. 104-117; Chen, Y.L., Chang, C.C., Sheu, D.F., Optimum random and age replacement policies for customer-demand multi-state system reliability under imperfect maintenance (2014) International Journal of Systems Science.

The timely analysis and monitoring of business processes are essential to identify non-compliant situations and react immediately to those inconsistencies in order to respond quickly to competitors. In this regard, the integration of business intelligence (BI) systems with Process Aware Information Systems (PAIS) can become a key tool for business users in decision making. However, current BI systems are not suitable for optimising and improving end-to-end processes since these are normally business domain specific and are not sufficiently process-aware to support the needs of process improvement type activities. In addition, highly transactional business environments may produce vast amounts of event data that cannot be efficiently managed by the use of traditional storage systems which are not designed to manage vast amounts of event data. We introduce a cloud-based architecture that leverages big-data technology to support performance analysis on any business domain, in a timely manner and regardless of the underlying concerns of the operational systems. Likewise, we demonstrate the ability of the solution to provide real-time business activity monitoring on big-data environments with low hardware costs. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Operational system captures the day-to-day operations and BI database refreshes operational data periodically. Methods: A component to create the metadata repository which maintains the current BI database summary by logical data partitioning using range based partition for frequently changing parameter which are critical to business. During different time frequency, using metadata repository component identifies the latest data victim between BI vs operational data and refreshes the modified victim to BI database. Findings: In traditional data loading approach from Operational system to BI database, huge volume of data gets refreshed periodically irrespective of modifications, which leads to higher processing time and cost. To overcome this limitation, this proposed methodology helps to identify the latest data victims present in operational systems instead of bulk data replacement which can minimize the processing time and enables faster data transformation to achieve ""Time to Decision"" and ""Quick to Market"" implementation for business enhancements. Also component can be scheduled for data refresh with different time frequency for multiple critical to business as well as frequently changing parameters. Applications: In financial, traffic, weather, e-business, Logistics & stock management transactions, data changes frequently and process big data periodically to gain real-time knowledge discovery for time sensitive decision making.","Frequently changing data; Time-sensitive business intelligence",,,,,,,"Batini, C., Scannapieca, M., (2006) Types of data representation.

One prominent strategy is to deploy advanced intelligence systems and analytics to monitor key performance indicators, capture insights about the behavior of the electricity generation processes, and identify factors affecting combustion efficiency. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to outline a way to incorporate a business intelligence framework into existing coal-fired power plant data to transform the data into insights and deliver analytical solutions to power producers. Design/methodology/approach - The proposed ten-step business intelligence framework combines the architectures of database management, business analytics, business performance management, and data visualization to manage existing enterprise data in a coal-fired power plant. Findings - The results of this study provide plant-wide signals of any unusual operational and coal-quality factors that impact the level of NOx and consequently explain and predict the leading causes of variation in the emission of NOx in the combustion process. Research limitations/implications - Once the framework is integrated into the power generation process, it is important to ensure that the top management and the data analysts at the plants have the same perceptions of the benefits of big data and analytics in the long run and continue to provide support and awareness of the use of business intelligence technology and infrastructure in operational decision making. Practical implications - The key finding of this study helps the power plant prioritize the important factors associated with the emission of NOx; closer attention to those factors can be promptly initiated in order to improve the performance of the plant. Originality/value - The use of big data is not just about implementing new technologies to store and manage bigger databases but rather about extracting value and creating insights from large volumes of data. The challenge is to strategically and operationally reconsider the entire process not only to prepare, integrate, and manage big data but also to make proper decisions as to which data to select for the analysis and how to apply analytical techniques to create value from the data that is in line with the strategic direction of the enterprise. This study seeks to fill this gap by outlining how to implement the proposed business intelligence framework to provide plant-wide signals of any unusual operational and coal-quality factors that impact the level of NOx and to explain and predict the leading causes of variation in the emission of NOx in the combustion process. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Big data;

This entrepreneurship plays a critical role in the construction of a venture business ecosystem. Meanwhile, big data, until now, have consisted only of numbers and texts that are specified and standardized by certain structured rules. Nowadays, however, big data analysis methods are being developed to gain information and business opportunities from new aspects through the use of nonstandard data. The big data technology is becoming a core element in the new digital age rather than just a trend, and the big data strategies are progressing from the testing stage to the implementation stage. In particular, as the importance of nonstandard data is increasing, limitations of the conventional system analysis appeared, and the analysis methods of advanced analytics are being highlighted. The scope of big data is anticipated to expand in enterprises with the emergence of many application cases, such as the real-time use of the data. The business model for the formation of the entrepreneurial ecosystem of the creative economy can assist the construction of an entrepreneurial platform as a catalyst for the stimulation of innovative business start-ups. This entrepreneurial platform can produce such effects as fast product development, commercialization of technology, risk reduction, and job creation. In this study, the operating model formation according to the characteristics of the industry or the business model in operation, the profit creation sources, the scope of value provision, and the priorities with regard to the required data were examined. Furthermore, cases related to the performance of big data business models of advanced corporations were examined, and a big data business model for the formation of the entrepreneurial ecosystem of the creative economy in the 21st century was derived. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.","Big data; Entrepreneurial ecosystem; Statistical analysis; Venture","Distributed computer systems; Ecology; Ecosystems; Employment; Statistical methods; Ubiquitous computing; Wireless sensor networks; Business modeling; Business opportunities; Business start-ups; Commercialization of technology; Conventional systems; Data analysis methods; Data technologies; Venture; Big data",,,,,,"Joo, H.J., Hong, B.H., Kim, S.S., Smart-contents visualization of publishing big data using NFC technology (2012) CCIS, 351, pp. 118-123; Weekly technical trends, 15 July 20113 (2011) Korean Agency for Digital Opportunity and Promotion (2011) New Value Creation Engine: The New Possibilities of Big Data and Responding Strategies; (2012) Weekly Technical Trends, , 11 April 11 2012; (1993) General Aspects of Quality of Service and Network Performance in Digital Networks, including Isdns, , March 1993; (2003) Network Performance Objectives for Ip-Based Services, , February 2003","Kim, H.; Kaywon College of ArtsSouth Korea; email: Hyoungro@hanamil.net","Shen H.Jeong Y.-S.Yi G.Park J.J.","","Springer Verlag","4th International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing Application and Wireless Sensor Network, UCAWSN 2015","8 July 2015 through 10 July 2015",,163149,18761100,9789811000676,,,"English","Lect.

The purpose of this paper is to develop a maturity model to support organisations in the realisation of the value created by Big Data. Design/methodology/approach - The maturity model is developed following a qualitative approach based on literature analysis and semi-structured interviews with domain experts. The completeness and usefulness of the model is evaluated qualitatively by practitioners, whereas the applicability of the model is evaluated by Big Data maturity assessments in three real-world organisations. Findings - The proposed maturity model is considered exhaustive by domain experts and has helped the three assessed organisations to develop a more critical understanding of the next steps to take. Originality/value - The maturity model integrates existing industry-developed maturity models into one single coherent Big Data maturity model. The proposed model answers the call for research on Big Data to abstract from technical issues to focus on the business implications of Big Data initiatives. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Analytics; Big data; Business value; Maturity model","Societies and institutions; Analytics; Business organisation; Business value; Design/methodology/approach; Literature analysis; Maturity model; Qualitative approach; Semi structured interviews; Big data",,,,,,"Asay, M., 8 reasons why Big Data projects fail (2014) InformationWeek, , www.informationweek.com/big-data/big-data-analytics/8-reasons-big-data-projects-fail/a/d-id/1297842, (accessed 1 November 2015); Becker, J., Knackstedt, R., Pöppelbuß, D.W.I.J., Developing maturity models for IT management (2009) Business & Information Systems Engineering, 1 (3), pp. 213-222; Betteridge, N., Nott, C., (2014) Big Data and Analytics Maturity Model, , www.ibmbigdatahub.com/blog/big-data-analytics-maturity-model, (accessed 1 November 2015); Bharadwaj, A., El Sawy, O.A., Pavlou, P.A., Venkatraman, N., Digital business strategy: Toward a next generation of insights (2013) Mis Quarterly, 37 (2), pp. 471-482; Buhl, H.U., Röglinger, M., Moser, D.K.F., Heidemann, J., Big data (2013) Business & Information Systems Engineering, 5 (2), pp. 65-69; Charmaz, K., (2014) Constructing Grounded Theory, , Sage London; Chen, C.P., Zhang, C.Y., Data-intensive applications, challenges, techniques and technologies: A survey on big data (2014) Information Sciences, 275 (10), pp. 314-347; Chen, H., Chiang, R.H., Storey, V.C., (2012) MIS Quarterly, 36 (4), pp. 1165-1188. , Business intelligence and analytics: from big data to big impact; Davenport, T., (2014) Big Data at Work: Dispelling the Myths, Uncovering the Opportunities, , Harvard Business Review Press, Boston; De Bruin, T., Freeze, R., Kaulkarni, U., Rosemann, M., Understanding the main phases of developing a maturity assessment model (2005) Australasian Conference on Information Systems (ACIS), , Campbell, B., Underwood, J. and Bunker D.

Performance measurement, data analytics, and program evaluation have been treated as different tasks, and those addressing them speak their own languages in their own circles. We suggest that situating performance measurement and data analytics within the broader field of evaluation would be theoretically parsimonious and fruitful. Scholars and practitioners of performance measurement and analytics may profitably use an evaluation mind-set and frame their tasks within the multidisciplinary field of evaluation practice. With this change in mind-set, we discuss some implications of viewing measurement, analytics, and other evaluation-related capacities within public organizations as part of an integrated, evaluation mission-support function. Working with other mission-support functions, evaluation capacity could be used by operating units to improve learning, strategy, and performance and better accomplish the mission. We outline steps that could be considered to help forge a more strategic and comprehensive approach to evaluation in public and nonprofit organizations. © 2015, SAGE Publications.

They are major source of employment and income in most countries. However, they need to be competitive to survive and grow in the present era of liberalized and digital economy, making national boundaries almost irrelevant. Most of the SMEs are inward looking and not very competitive. They merely survive and sooner than later, seize to exist. One of the reasons for this lackluster performance is their inability to access and analyze right kind of information for decision making. Large corporates can afford to hire world class consultancy firms like McKinsey, Price Waterhouse Coopers, etc. whereas MSMEs find it almost impossible to afford them. These large firms get extra advantage, as the information generated by analysis of data collected using reliable research methodology, accurately serves the purpose of aiding them in making decisions under intricate situations. Also, data related to visitors of social media sites and navigation patterns on portals are widely used by large firms for predictive analysis. On the other hand, decision making at MSMEs is often based on ad-hoc methods or gut feeling making them more vulnerable to failures. Although, globalization has led to increased competition, it also offers opportunities for expansion of business, for firms with strategic and competitive strengths. Furthermore, the size of firm does not matter. In this era of digital economy, business success is strongly associated with up-to-date information and knowledge of markets, consumers and competitors acquired using scientifically proven research methods. Business research is vital for sustainability of SMEs in global economy. To grab opportunities that globalization offers, MSMEs need information to support their decisions on target markets, product-mix, branding, consumer perception, trends, supply and demand forecasting and quality control.

Hence, researchers have made many calls to enhance business analytics training in business schools to meet the growing market demand for analyticssavvy employees. A growing set of business analytics courses have begun to address these calls. In this paper, we examine the maturity of business analytics offerings in business schools in the United States by analyzing current business analytics-related course offerings of the top 104 business schools (363 courses) and 20 unranked business schools (51 courses) in the United States. We analyze these data by examining the types of courses offered and rank the schools based on their maturity levels in terms of business analytics offerings. Our findings indicate that, to the extent that these schools reflect what is happening across the nation, business schools still have a long way to go before they reach higher levels of business analytics maturity and that they are not yet in an ideal position to serve the presumed industry needs.

Quantitative EEGs produce complex data sets derived from digitally analyzed electrical activity at different frequency bands, at multiple electrode locations, and under different vigilance (eyes open vs. closed) states, resulting in potential feature patterns which may be diagnostically useful, but detectable only with advanced mathematical models. Methods: This paper uses a data mining methodology for classifying EEGs of 53 MDD patients and 43 HVs. This included: (a) pre-processing the data, including cleaning and normalization, applying Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to map the features into a new feature space; and applying Genetic Algorithm (GA) to identify the most significant features; (b) building predictive models using the Decision Tree (DT) algorithm to discover rules and hidden patterns based on the reduced and mapped features; and (c) evaluating the models based on the accuracy and false positive values on the EEG data of MDD and HV participants. Two categories of experiments were performed. The first experiment analyzed each frequency band individually, while the second experiment analyzed the bands together. Results: Application of LDA and GA markedly reduced the total number of utilized features by ≥ 50 % and, with all frequency bands analyzed together, the model showed average classification accuracy (MDD vs. HV) of 80 %. The best results from model testing with additional test EEG recordings from 9 MDD patients and 35 HV individuals demonstrated an accuracy of 80 % and showed an average sensitivity of 70 %, a specificity of 76 %, and a positive (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of 74 and 75 %, respectively. Conclusions: These initial findings suggest that the proposed automated EEG analytical approach could be a useful adjunctive diagnostic approach in clinical practice. © 2015 Mohammadi et al.","Decision tree; Depression; EEG; Genetic algorithm; Linear discriminant analysis; Sensitivity; Specificity",,,,,,,"Kessler, R., Chiu, W., Demier, U., Merikangas, K., Walters, E., Prevalence, severity, and comorbidity of 12-month DSM-IV disorders in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (2015) Arch Gen Psychiatry, 62, pp. 617-627; Yach, D., Hawkes, C., Gould, C., Hofman, K., The global burden of chronic disorders: Overcoming impediments to prevention and control (2004) JAMA, 291, pp. 2616-2622. , 15173153 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD2cXkslWns78%3D; Murray, T., Vos, T., Lozano, R., Naghavi, M., Flaxman, A.D., Michaud, C., Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for 291 diseases and injuries in 21 regions, 1990-2010 (2010) A Systematic Analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study.

In the last decades, the Impact Factor (i.e., the most known quantitative approach) has been widely questioned, and other indices have thus been developed and become popular. Previous studies have reported strengths and weaknesses of each index, and devised meta-indices to rank journals in a certain field of study. However, the proposed meta-indices exhibit some intrinsic limitations: (1) the indices to be combined are not always chosen according to well-grounded principles; (2) combination methods are usually unweighted; and (3) some of the proposed meta-indices are parametric, which requires assuming a specific underlying data distribution. We propose a data-driven methodology that linearly combines an arbitrary number of indices to produce an aggregated ranking, using different techniques from statistics and machine learning to estimate the combining weights. We additionally consider correlations between indices and meta-indices, to quantitatively evaluate their differences. Finally, we empirically show that the considered meta-indices are also robust to significant perturbations of the values of the combined indices. © 2015, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Combining journal ranking indices; Journal quality evaluation; Meta-indices",,,,,,,"Bador, P., Lafouge, T., Comparative analysis between impact factor and h-index for pharmacology and psychiatry journals (2010) Scientometrics, 84 (1), pp. 65-79; Bergstrom, C., Measuring the value and prestige of scholarly journals (2007) College & Research Libraries News, 68 (5), pp. 314-316; Bishop, C.M., (2007) Pattern recognition and machine learning (Information Science and Statistics), , Springer, Berlin; Bornmann, L., Marx, W., Gasparyan, A.Y., Kitas, G.D., Diversity, value and limitations of the journal impact factor and alternative metrics (2012) Rheumatology International, 32 (7), pp. 1861-1867; Braun, T., Glänzel, W., Schubert, A., A hirsch-type index for journals (2006) Scientometrics, 69 (1), pp. 169-173; DuBois, F.L., Reeb, D., Ranking the international business journals (2000) Journal of International Business Studies, 31 (4), pp. 689-704; Scimago journal & country rank (2015) University of Washington Retrieved in July, p. 2015. , http://www.eigenfactor.org/about.php; Falagas, M.E., Kouranos, V.D., Arencibia-Jorge, R., Karageorgopoulos, D.E., Comparison of scimago journal rank indicator with journal impact factor (2008) The FASEB Journal, 22 (8), pp. 2623-2628; Garfield, E., Citation indexes for science: A new dimension in documentation through association of ideas (2006) International Journal of Epidemiology, 35 (5), pp. 1123-1127; Garfield, E., Sher, I.H., New factors in the evaluation of scientific literature through citation indexing (1963) American Documentation, 14 (3), pp. 195-201; González-Pereira, B., Guerrero-Bote, V.P., Moya-Anegón, F., A new approach to the metric of journals’ scientific prestige: The SJR indicator (2010) Journal of Informetrics, 4 (3), pp. 379-391; Hirsch, J.E., An index to quantify an individual’s scientific research output (2005) Proceedings of the National academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 102 (46), pp. 569-572; Hodge, D.R., Lacasse, J., (2010), Evaluating journal quality: Is the h-index a better measure than impact factors?

Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) equips analytics experts with the technological capabilities to support decision processes with reliable information and analytic insights, thus potentially raising the quality of managerial decision making. However, the very nature of organizational decision processes imposes conflicting task requirements regarding adaptability and rigor. This research proposes ambidexterity as a theoretical lens to investigate data-centric decision support. Based on an in-depth multiple case study of BI&A-supported decision processes, we identify and discuss tensions that arise from the conflicting task requirements and that pose a challenge for effective BI&A support. We also provide insights into tactics for managing these tensions and thus achieving ambidexterity. Additionally, we shed light on the relationship between ambidexterity and decision quality. Integrating the empirical findings from this research, we propose a theory of ambidexterity in decision support, which explains how such ambidexterity can be facilitated and how it affects decision outcomes. Finally, we discuss the study's implications for theory and practice. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Ambidexterity; Business intelligence and analytics; Decision processes","Decision making; Decision support systems; Information analysis; Ambidexterity; Decision process; Decision supports; Empirical findings; Managerial decision making; Multiple-case study; Technological capability; Theory and practice; Decision theory",,,,,,"Chaudhuri, S., Dayal, U., Narasayya, V., An overview of business intelligence technology (2011) Commun.

In the first algorithm, medical cloud platforms perform a joint queue-backlog and rate-aware scheduling decisions for matching deployed access points (APs) and medical users where APs are eventually connected to medical clouds. In the second algorithm, each scheduled medical device computes the amounts of power allocation to upload its own medical data to medical big-data clouds with stochastic decision making considering joint energy-efficiency and buffer stability optimization. Through extensive simulations, the proposed algorithms are shown to achieve the desired results. © 2015 IEEE.","60 GHz; dynamic buffering; IEEE 802.11ad; medical big-data platforms; Stochastic decision making","Algorithms; Big data; Biomedical equipment; Crowdsourcing; Energy efficiency; Medical imaging; Optimization; Scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; Stochastic systems; 60 GHz; Access point (APs); Buffer stabilities; Data platform; Decision-making algorithms; Extensive simulations; IEEE 802.11ad; Scheduling decisions; Decision making",,,,,,"Huang, H., (2010) PACS and Imaging Informatics 2nd Ed, , Hoboken NJ USA: Wiley; Xia, Y., Zhou, M.C., Luo, X., Pang, S., Zhu, Q., A stochastic approach to analysis of energy-aware DVS-enabled cloud datacenters (2015) IEEE Trans.

We address this issue by offering a different perspective that reconciles the conflicting desires of businesses and consumers. We describe privacy, data mining, and their interaction in the larger context, identify the costs and benefits of the uses of data mining, and discuss potential stakeholders found at the intersection of the two subjects. To help synthesize our proposed code of ethical conduct, we examine existing codes of conduct and how they relate to the issue of privacy in the context of data mining with people, processes, and technology. Showing that a uniform code of ethical conduct for online privacy is feasible from both a managerial and ethical perspective, we provide an initial philosophical and principle synthesis that businesses and organizations can tailor for their own specific customers and needs. The developed code of ethical conduct respects consumers’ desire for privacy while allowing businesses to use data mining techniques to elicit information that benefits both the business and the consumer. © 2015 by the Association for Information Systems.","Code of conduct; Data mining; Ethics; Knowledge; Learning; Privacy","Codes (symbols); Data privacy; Philosophical aspects; Code of conduct; Costs and benefits; Ethical perspectives; Ethics; Government organizations; Knowledge; Learning; Online business; Data mining",,,,,,"Barnes, J., (1984) The Complete Works of Aristotle: The Revised Oxford Translation, , Princeton: Princeton University Press; Azmi, I.M., Bioinformatics and genetic privacy: The impact of the Personal Data Protection Act of 2010 (2011) Computer Law and Security Review, 27, pp. 394-401; Baumer, D.L., Poindexter, J.C., Earp, J.B., Meaningful and meaningless choices in cyberspace (2004) Journal of Internet Law, 7 (11), pp. 3-11; Bennett, C.J., An international standard for privacy protection: Objections to the objections (2000) Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Computers, Freedom and Privacy: Challenging the Assumptions, pp. 33-38. , New York, NY: ACM; Bragues, G., Seek the good life, not money: The Aristotelian approach to business ethics (2006) Journal of Business Ethics, 67 (4), pp. 341-357; Carroll, A.B., A three-dimensional conceptual model of corporate performance (1979) Academy of Management Review, 4 (4), pp. 497-505; Carusi, A., Jirotka, M., From data archive to ethical labyrinth (2009) Qualitative Research, 9 (3), pp. 285-298; Collingwood, L., Privacy, anonymity and liability: Will anonymous communicators have the last laugh?

These systems generate a lot of data but fail to effectively convert these data into actionable information for decision makers. Such ineffectiveness often is attributed to a lack of alignment between strategic planning and information technology (IT) initiatives supporting operational goals. We present a case study that illustrates how the use of digital dashboards at St. Joseph Mercy Oakland (SJMO) Hospital in Pontiac, Michigan, was instrumental in supporting such an alignment. Driven by a focus on key performance indicators (KPIs), dashboard applications also led to other tangible and intangible benefits. An ability to track KPIs over time and against established targets, with drill-down capabilities, allowed leadership to hold staff members accountable for achieving their performance targets. By displaying the dashboards in prominent locations (such as operational unit floors, the physicians' cafeteria, and nursing stations), SJMO ushered in transparency in the planning and monitoring processes. The need to develop KPI metrics and drive data collection efforts became ingrained in the work ethos of people at every level of the organization. Although IT-enabled dashboards have been instrumental in supporting this cultural transformation, the focus of investment was the ability of technology to make collective vision and action the responsibility of all stakeholders.",,"health care quality; health services research; organization; private hospital; quality control; United States; Benchmarking; California; Decision Making, Organizational; Hospitals, Religious; Organizational Case Studies; Quality Indicators, Health Care",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10969012,,,26554142,"English","J Healthc Manag",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84952879124

In this paper, a two-stage maintenance framework using data-driven techniques under two training types will be developed to predict the degradation status in industrial applications. The proposed framework consists of three main blocks, namely, Primary Maintenance Block (PMB), Secondary Maintenance Block (SMB), and degradation status determination block. As the popular methods with deterministic training, back-propagation Neural Network (NN) and evolvable NN are employed in PMB for the degradation prediction. Another two data-driven methods with probabilistic training, namely, restricted Boltzmann machine and deep belief network are applied in SMB as the backup of PMB to model non-stationary processes with the complicated underlying characteristics. Finally, the multiple regression forecasting is adopted in both blocks to check prediction accuracies. The effectiveness of our proposed two-stage maintenance framework is testified with extensive computation and experimental studies on an industrial case of the wafer fabrication plant in semiconductor manufactories, achieving up to 74.1% in testing accuracies for equipment degradation prediction. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Condition-based maintenance;

We succeeded in stopping equipment and lots automatically when the equipment was detected as fault condition. In addition, we developed the environment that enables immediate data collection for analysis by the data aggregation and merging functions, which extracts keys correlating to yield from the equipment's parameter.

Drawing on the information processing view and contingency theory, this paper develops a research model linking business analytics to organizational DME. The research model is tested using structural equation modeling based on 740 responses collected from U.K. businesses. The key findings demonstrate that business analytics, through the mediation of a data-driven environment, positively influences information processing capability, which in turn has a positive effect on DME. The findings also demonstrate that the paths from business analytics to DME have no statistical differences between large and medium companies, but some differences between manufacturing and professional service industries. Our findings contribute to the business analytics literature by providing useful insights into business analytics applications and the facilitation of data-driven decision making. They also contribute to managers' knowledge and understanding by demonstrating how business analytics should be implemented to improve DME. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Business analytics (BA); contingency theory; data-driven environment (DDE); decision-making effectiveness (DME); information processing capability (IPC); information processing view","Decision theory; Information science; Business analytics; Contingency theory; Data driven; Information processing capability; Organizational levels; Professional services; Statistical differences; Structural equation modeling; Decision making",,,,,,"Davenport, T.H., Harris, J.G., (2007) Competing on Analytics: The New Science of Winning, , Boston, MA, USA: Harvard Business School Review Press; Davenport, T.H., Analytics 3.0 (2013) Harvard Bus.

Exhibiting organizations demand higher levels of justification for involvement and expect returns on trade show investments. This study proposes an RFID-enabled track and traceability framework to improve information visibility at the trade site. The identification information can potentially create detailed, accurate, and complete visibility of attendees' movements and purchasing behaviors and consequently lead to considerable analytical benefits. Leveraging the wealth of information made available by RFID is challenging; thus, the objective of this study is to outline how to incorporate RFID data into existing enterprise data to deliver analytical solutions to the trade show and exhibition industry. The results show that the exhibitor can use RFID to gather visitor intelligence and the key findings of this study provide valuable feedback to business analysts to promote follow-up marketing strategies. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Analytics;

With the recent growth in the use of analytics in the business environment, more customers are seeking to integrate analytics into their core operational environments to enable real-time insight on operational data for competitive advantage. IBM z Systems support very high-performance computation for business analytics. The z System processors are typically higher frequency than any general-purpose microprocessor, and with the zEnterprise® 196 (z196) system, huge gains in performance were made through out-of-order execution. The robust cache hierarchy also provides additional performance boosts to high concurrency analytics operations. The IBM z13™ extends these performance improvements with a new SIMD (single-instruction, multiple-data) engine in the processor for targeted acceleration of business analytics workloads. This SIMD engine supports new instructions for three data types: integer, string, and floating-point. We provide an overview of the z13 SIMD architecture and show how it advances current architectures. We also discuss the compiler and math library support for this new architecture and provide a few examples of applications that can be accelerated by this new hardware feature on the z13. © 1957-2012 IBM.",,"Competition; Digital arithmetic; Engines; Business environments; Competitive advantage; General-purpose microprocessors; High performance computation; Higher frequencies; Operational environments; Out-of-order execution; Single instruction , multiple datum; Architecture",,,,,,"Zakhar, P., IBM DB2 analytics accelerator V4.1 expands the value of high performance analytics (2013) IBM Syst.

The shape using the aspect ratio value expressed the quality of pellets. A data matrix for chemometric analysis consisted of 224 pellet formulations performed by means of eight different active pharmaceutical ingredients and several various excipients, using different extrusion/spheronization process conditions. The data set contained 14 input variables (both formulation and process variables) and one output variable (pellet aspect ratio). A tree regression algorithm consistent with the Quality by Design concept was applied to obtain deeper understanding and knowledge of formulation and process parameters affecting the final pellet sphericity. The clear interpretable set of decision rules were generated. The spehronization speed, spheronization time, number of holes and water content of extrudate have been recognized as the key factors influencing pellet aspect ratio. The most spherical pellets were achieved by using a large number of holes during extrusion, a high spheronizer speed and longer time of spheronization. The described data mining approach enhances knowledge about pelletization process and simultaneously facilitates searching for the optimal process conditions which are necessary to achieve ideal spherical pellets, resulting in good flow characteristics. This data mining approach can be taken into consideration by industrial formulation scientists to support rational decision making in the field of pellets technology. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, there is no well-established methodology to study the dynamics of this network. Traditional approaches have primarily utilized a single source of data of relatively established firms; however, these approaches ignore the vast number of relevant activities that often occur at the individual and entrepreneurial levels. We argue that a data-driven visualization approach, using both institutionally and socially curated datasets, can provide important complementary, triangulated explanatory insights into the dynamics of interorganizational networks in general and business ecosystems in particular. We develop novel visualization layouts to help decision makers systemically identify and compare ecosystems. Using traditionally disconnected data sources on deals and alliance relationships (DARs), executive and funding relationships (EFRs), and public opinion and discourse (POD), we empirically illustrate our data-driven method of data triangulation and visualization techniques through three cases in the mobile industry Google's acquisition of Motorola Mobility, the coopetitive relation between Apple and Samsung, and the strategic partnership between Nokia and Microsoft. The article concludes with implications and future research opportunities. © 2015 ACM 2158-656X/2015/05-ART6 $15.00.","Business ecosystem; Data triangulation; Information visualization; Interorganizational networks","Complex networks; Decision making; Dynamics; Ecology; Ecosystems; Information systems; Social aspects; Surveying; Triangulation; Visualization; Business ecosystem; Data-driven approach; Information visualization; Inter-organizational network; Research opportunities; Strategic partnership; Traditional approaches; Visualization technique; Data visualization",,,,,,"Adner, R., (2012) The Wide Lens: A New Strategy for Innovation, , Penguin Group, New York, NY; Ahuja, G., Collaboration networks, structural holes, and innovation: A longitudinal study (2000) Administrative Science Quarterly, 45 (3), pp. 425-455. , 2000; Ahuja, G., Soda, G., Zaheer, A., The genesis and dynamics of organizational networks (2011) Organization Science, 23 (2), pp. 443-448. , 2011; Alsallakh, B., Micallef, L., Aigner, W., Hauser, H., Miksch, S., Rodgers, P., Visualizing sets and settyped data: State-of-the-art and future challenges (2014) EuroVis - STARs, , R.

Dealing with huge amounts of structured and unstructured data, often referred as Big Data, is a hot research topic and a technological challenge. In this paper, the authors present an approach aimed to enable OLAP queries over different, heterogeneous, data sources. Their approach is based on a MapReduce paradigm, which integrates different formats into the recent RDF Data Cube format. The benefits of their approach are that it is capable of querying different sources of information, while maintaining at the same time, an integrated, comprehensive view of the data available. The paper discusses the advantages and disadvantages, as well as the implementation challenges that such approach presents. Furthermore, the approach is evaluated in detail by means of a case study.

Usually, in an SNS system, active users may not represent the major opinions among the whole users, and most of the users' opinions may be multifarious. In this paper, we focus on analyzing and identifying users' dynamical social roles to facilitate the collective decision-making process. After introducing the social choice theory and an improved collective decision-making model, we present a three-layer model to analyze users' social roles in a hierarchical way and develop an integrated mechanism to utilize the identification of social roles to support the collective decision making. Based on a developed NetLogo-based tool, a case study for the course-offering determination with an application scenario is demonstrated to show the process of using users' social roles to support the collective decision making. The comparison experiment conducted between our method and the Delphi method shows the usefulness of our proposed method to help users achieve the decision consensus in a more efficient way. © 2015 IEEE.","Collective Decision Making; Data Mining; Social Media; Social Roles; User Model","Data mining; Decision making; Hierarchical systems; Social networking (online); Application scenario; Collective decision making; Decision consensus; Hierarchical model; Personalized service; Social choice theory; Social networking services; Three-layer models; Decision theory",,,,,,"Zhang, Y., Zhou, Y., Transparent computing: Spatio-temporal extension on von Neumann architecture for cloud services (2013) Tsinghua Sci.

Obtaining useful knowledge to enable better decisions to be made in order to improve business performance is not a trivial task. The most fundamental challenge for Big Data extraction is to handle the uncertainty of data to meet emerging business needs, such as marketing analysis, future prediction and decision making. In this paper, we firstly propose a novel approach called Dominating Top-k Aggregate Query (DA-Topk) to provide trustworthy and reliable informative knowledge from uncertain Big Data by combining the techniques of skyline and top-k queries. Then, we design a number of pruning rules to reduce the search space and terminate the ranking process as early as possible. Next, we provide a deeper analysis regarding the satisfaction of the six ranking properties (i.e. exact-k, containment, unique-rank, value-invariance, stability and faithfulness) between our approach and existing approaches to demonstrate that our method is the only one which satisfied all of these properties. Extensive experiments with both real and synthetic data sets have been conducted to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed approach compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. Our approach can help managers make strategic decisions quickly and accurately in competitive market places. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Unlike existing disaster risk reduction (DRR) systems, Smart-Evac takes cloud computing and big data characteristics into consideration during decision making. The authors consider human anxiety to be a major contributor to network congestion immediately following a disaster. They envision tracing clusters of trapped peoples where network usage is comparatively high. The Smart-Evac system ranks these clusters based on volume, velocity, and variety (the 3Vs of big data). Based on this ranking, the system provides immediate evacuation service to the top-listed clusters to mitigate the exponential rise of network congestion. The system used the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to achieve the proper ranking of the clusters to support decision makers efficiently. In addition, Smart-Evac provides immediate cloud-based basic healthcare facilities and ambulatory medical services to victims after successful evacuation. Immediate priority-based healthcare in turn reduces the haphazard rush to nearby hospitals. © 2015 IEEE.","analytic hierarchy processing; big data; cloud; cloud computing; disaster risk reduction; emergency evacuation","Cloud computing; Clouds; Data handling; Decision making; Disasters; Distributed computer systems; Health care; Reduction; Analytic hierarchy; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Data characteristics; Disaster risk reductions; Emergency evacuation; Healthcare facility; Natural disasters; Network congestions; Big data",,,,,,"Alexander, D., (1993) Natural Disasters, , Routledge; India raises flood death toll reaches 5,700 as all missing persons now presumed dead (2013) CBS News, , www.cbsnews.com/news/india-raises-flood-death-toll-reaches-5700-as-all-missing-persons-now-presumed-dead, 16 July; Kala, C.P., Deluge, disaster and development in Uttarakhand Himalayan region of India: Challenges and lessons for disaster management (2014) Int'l J.

We also discuss the challenges that auditors encounter when incorporating Big Data in audit analyses and the various analytical tools that are currently used by companies in the analysis of Big Data.

Today, however, dramatic improvements in hardware perfor-mance, advances in various types of sensors, and changes in the social environment such as consumer-driven dissemination of information via social networking services (SNSs) are gen-erating a great need for ""big data"" analysis. In its early stages, the use of big data depended on information and communications technology (ICT) specialists and expert analysts located at support sites. Now, to speed up decision-making at sites directly involved in increasing sales and lowering costs, analysis based on big data is being performed at these frontline sites, and some marketing and planning departments have already begun to base their actions on big data. Moreover, high-function middleware that facilitates such big data usage has been ap-pearing. However, issues arising in actual implementations of systems with such middleware have hindered advanced decision-making in the field. This paper introduces Fujitsu's approach to resolving these issues by providing integrated solutions that optimally combine big-data middleware and analysis scenarios and describes the effects of introducing these solutions.",,"Decision making; Digital storage; Middleware; Social networking (online); Analysis solution; Corporate values; Decision making process; Employee productivity; Information and communications technology; Integrated solutions; Social environment; Social networking services; Big data",,,,,,"Fujitsu, Fujitsu Provides Big-Data Solutions to Transform the Front Lines of Business, , http://www.fulitsu.com/global/about/resources/news/press-releases/2014/0513-01.html; Fujitsu, FUJITSU Software Big Data, , http://www.fujitsu.com/global/products/software/middleware/application-infrastructure/interstage/solutions/big-data; Fujitsu, FUJITSU Software Interstage Big Data Parallel Processing Server, , http://www.fujitsu.com/global/products/software/middleware/application-infrastructure/interstage/solutions/big-data/bdpp; Fujitsu, FUJITSU Software Interstage Big Data Complex Event Processing Server, , http://interstage.fujitsu.com/jp/bigdataceps; Fujitsu, Fujitsu Enhances Big Data Analytics Solution to Facilitate Decision-Making on the Front Lines of Business, , http://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/resources/news/press-releases/2014/0814-01.html",,,,"Fujitsu Ltd",,,,,00162523,,FUSTA,,"English","Fujitsu Sci Tech J",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928249660

Decisions depend on the decision-makers´ knowledge and intuition, the characteristics of decision task as well as the quality of the data analysed. Focusing on the decision objective component, it appears that the contemporary business context is characterised by: (i) a vast amount of data, but not all of this is meaningful; and (ii) an unexplored kind of data, namely qualitative data. The aim of the paper is twofold. Firstly, to elaborate a theoretical framework integrating Big Data technology into strategic decision-making. And secondly, assessing the feasibility of the elaborated model on a strategic variable in the hi-tech field. © 2015, Universidad de Huelva.

Also, data volume, data velocity and data variety continue to increase. Data-driven decision making using these new data streams, often call “big” data, is an important topic for continuing discussion and research. Given the costs of this data it is important to understand “big” data and any decision making use cases. Current use cases demonstrate how new data streams can support some operating decisions. Claims that new data streams can support strategic decision making by senior managers have not been demonstrated. Managers want better data and desire the “right” data at the “right time” and in the “right format” to support targeted decisions. This article explores the challenges of identifying novel use cases relevant to decision making, especially important, strategic long-term decisions. Analyzing “big data” to find a great business plan or to identify the next revolutionary product idea seems however like wishful thinking. Data is useful and we have more of it than ever before and the volume is increasing because data capture and storage is inexpensive. “Big data” and advanced analytics may provide facts for experienced and talented strategic decision makers, but those uses are not clearly defined. At present, the major strategic decision related to “big” data for senior managers is how much time, talent and money to allocate to capturing, storing and analyzing new data streams. Better defined decision making use cases can help senior managers assess the value of new data sources. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Analytics; Big data; Computerized decision support; Data-driven decision making; New data streams; Strategic decision making; Use cases","Data communication systems; Decision making; Decision support systems; Digital storage; Managers; Artificial intelligence; Analytics; Computerized decision; Data driven decision; Data stream; Strategic decision making; Use cases; Big data",,,,,,"Anthony, R.N., (1965) Planning and Control Systems: A Framework for Analysis, , Harvard University Press, Cambridge; Brynjolfsson, E., Hitt, L.M., Kim, H.H., Strength in numbers: How does data-driven decisionmaking affect firm performance?

Although school and administrative leaders are recognizing the need to provide support to teachers on how to interpret and respond to data, there is little theoretically sound research on data-driven decision making (DDDM) to guide their efforts. Drawing on sociocultural learning theory, extant empirical literature, and findings from a recent study, this paper develops a framework for understanding how to build teacher capacity to use data, specifically informing what practices administrators might employ, when in the DDDM process to employ these practices, and how these mechanisms may build teacher knowledge and skills. Given the global economic climate, administrators face difficult choices in how to invest scarce resources to support data use and once invested, how to ensure that teachers gain, and sustain, the needed capabilities once the supports are removed. The framework provided herein presents a set of concepts that may be useful in guiding these decisions. Implications for leadership practice, as well as suggestions to guide future research and theory development, are discussed. © The Author(s) 2014","accountability; data team; data use; Data-driven decision making; literacy coach; professional learning community; school and district leadership; sociocultural learning theory",,,,,,,"Ackoff, R., From data to wisdom (1989) Journal of Applied Systems Analysis, 16 (1), pp. 3-9; Anderson, S., Leithwood, K., Strauss, T., Leading data use in schools: Organizational conditions and practices (2010) Leadership and Policy in Schools, 9 (3), pp. 292-327; Archer, E., Scherman, V., Howie, S., (2013) Data-based Decision Making in Education: Challenges and Opportunities, pp. 91-112. , ,,.

While a growing body of literature indicates in-service teachers are resistant to DDDM and underprepared to engage in it, little has been done to understand pre-service teachers while they are still in the ideal arena in which to address resistance and subsequently build DDDM skills. The purpose of this study was to examine pre-service teachers’ affective response to the classroom-level DDDM via their concerns profile (n = 78). Participants’ concerns profile revealed that much like in-service teacher literature suggests, this sample of pre-service teachers were resistant to learning more about DDDM, believed they knew of better innovations for use, and are unlikely to use DDDM in their future classrooms. The findings provide important insight for those of us tasked with covering this topic in our educational psychology courses. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","concerns; data-driven decision-making; Educational psychology",,,,,,,"Airola, D.T., Dunn, K.E., (2011) Oregon DATA Project final evaluation report, , http://oregondataproject.org/files/data.k12partners.org/2011-0909_FinalStateReport.docx, Fayetteville, AR: Next Level Evaluation, Inc., Retrieved from; Top 20 principles from psychology for preK–12 teaching and learning (2015) Retrieved from, , http://www.apa.org/ed/schools/cpse/top-twenty-principles.pdf; Brown, G.T., Lake, R., Matters, G., Queensland teachers’ conceptions of assessment: The impact of policy priorities on teacher attitudes (2011) Teaching and Teacher Education, 27, pp. 210-220; Carlson, D., Borman, G., Robinson, M., A multistate district-level cluster randomized trial of the impact of data-driven reform on reading and mathematics achievement (2011) Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, 33, pp. 378-398; (2011) InTASC model core teaching standards: A resource for state dialogue, , http://www.ccsso.org/Documents/2011/InTASC_Model_Core_Teaching_Standards_2011.pdf, Washington, D.C: CCSSO., Retrieved from; Dantow, A., Hubbard, L., Teachers’ use of assessment data to inform instruction: Lessons from the past and prospects for the future (2015) Teachers College Record, 117 (4). , http://www.tcrecord.org/library; Davidson, K.L., Frohbieter, G., (2011) District adoption and implementation of interim and benchmark assessments.

This study begins with a twofold analysis of three hydrographical basins: one analysis based on the data of a recently constructed flood-impact database for Portugal and another based on selected socioeconomic and biophysical variables that characterize the basins' territorial context. From these sets of data, two fuzzy inference systems are assembled: one for the resource criteria and another for the time criteria. When plotted, the fuzzy analysis results are associated with distinct flood risk management strategies: operational and strategic, hard and soft measure-based. The three basins differ substantially in terms of flood-impact characteristics, with impacts being distinguished in terms of human and material consequences. Socioeconomic factors seem to be more explicative of flood impacts than the biophysical contexts that generate floods. The fuzzy logic analysis suggested priorities of action: early warning and information for one of the basins (Mondego) and a less operational solution, combining structural mitigation and land-use planning, for the other two basins (Lis and Vouga). Considering the current implementation of the Floods Directive, design of flood risk maps and flood risk management plans can benefit from the integration of the presented methodology. © 2015 by the authors.","Database; Fuzzy analysis; Impact; Risk management; Territorial context","Database systems; Decision making; Economics; Flood control; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Hydrographic surveys; Land use; Maps; Risk assessment; Risk management; Bio-physical variables; Flood risk management; Fuzzy analysis; Fuzzy inference systems; Impact; Impact characteristics; Operational solutions; Territorial context; Floods; database; decision making; early warning system; flood damage; fuzzy mathematics; risk assessment; socioeconomic impact",,,,,,"Cai, X., McKinney, D., Lasdon, L.S., Integrated hydrologic-agronomic-economic model for river basin management (2003) J.

It focuses on the design and implementation of the Conditional Grants Scheme-Local Government Areas (CGS-LGA). CGS-LGA is an active federal policy programme in Nigeria aimed at transforming education policy into practice by providing technology and training to local, decision-makers to create local level plans based on data and then identifying the funding gaps for implementation of the plans. This article discusses the importance of the use of data in planning and in substantiating grant applications, as well as how CGS-LGA was introduced into Nigeria, and lessons learnt from the introduction of the program. A literature review provides information on the development of data-driven planning, and important components of such planning: development of data systems, importance of information to reform education practices, linking information through data to build accountability, and data-driven decision-making.","Data-driven decision-making; Education policy; Educational planning; Local government; Millennium development goals; Nigeria",,,,,,,"Aiyar, Y., (2013) Learning outcome and important goal., , http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/Z5V9o6AJ9iMeHEIWgFP1HI/Leaning-outcome-an-important-goal.html; Banerjee, A., Banerji, R., Duflo, E., Glennerster, R., Khemani, S., (2007) Can informational campaigns raise awareness and local participation in primary education in India?, , http://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/can-informational-campaigns-raise-awareness-and-local-participation-primary-education-ind; Bettesworth, L.R., Alonzo, J., Duesbery, L., Swimming in the depths: Educators' ongoing effective use of data to guide decision making (2009) Data-based decision making in education, pp. 286-303. , T.

University StreetIN, United States","Introduction: Health systems globally and within the USA have introduced nursing home pay-for-performance (P4P) programmes in response to the need for improved nursing home quality. Central to the challenge of administering effective P4P is the availability of accurate, timely and clinically appropriate data for decision making. We aimed to explore ways in which data were collected, thought about and used as a result of participation in a P4P programme. Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 232 nursing home employees from within 70 nursing homes that participated in P4P-sponsored quality improvement (QI) projects. Interview data were analysed to identify themes surrounding collecting, thinking about and using data for QI decision making. Results: The term 'data' appeared 247 times in the interviews, and over 92% of these instances (228/247) were spontaneous references by nursing home staff. Overall, 34% of respondents (79/232) referred directly to 'data' in their interviews. Nursing home leadership more frequently discussed data use than direct care staff. Emergent themes included using data to identify a QI problem, gathering data in new ways at the local level, and measuring outcomes in response to P4P participation. Alterations in data use as a result of policy change were theoretically consistent with the revised version of the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services framework, which posits that successful implementation is a function of evidence, context and facilitation. Conclusions: Providing a reimbursement context that facilitates the collection and use of reliable local evidence may be an important consideration to others contemplating the adaptation of P4P policies. © 2015, BMJ Publishing Group.

In dealing with DDDM, higher education institutions (HEI), among schools, are found to be the most in need of such decision-support frameworks, because of the volume of the data they deal with, and the sensitivities of the decisions they make. To attend to this, though with an exclusive focus on the HEI’s students, we propose a DDDM conceptual framework, using a Design Research Method. The method includes critical literature review, survey instrument administration on the HEI policymakers, and interview sessions with data management personnel. Our proposed conceptual framework shows (1) how DDDM can achieve effective students’ data usage and improved students-related decision making, (2) HEI decision makers’ data usages, their preferred explicit knowledge from the data, and the relationship with the appropriate data variables. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.","Conceptual framework; Data-driven decision making; Higher education institutions; Students’ data",,,,,,,"(2011) Oracle Higher Education Constituent Hub (HECH), , http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/master-data-management/education-research-hech-ds-164687.pdf, Retrieved on 6th June, 2013; Jackson, S.S., A continuous Improvement Framework: Data Driven Decision- Making in Mathematics Education, , A 2013 White Paper Publication of Data- Driven Innovation Consulting, Inc; Semiu, A., Zulikha, J., Students' data-driven decision making in HEI: The explicit knowledge involved (2014) Proceedings of 5th International Conference on Future Information Technology, , Bangkok, Thailand, October; Gill, B., Borden, B.C., Hallgren, K., (2014) A conceptual framework for data-driven decision making, Final Report of Research conducted by Mathematica Policy Research, , Princeton, Submitted to Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, WA; Bogard, M., Green, B., (2013) A Data Driven Analytic Strategy for Increasing Yield and Retention at Western Kentucky University Using SAS Enterprise BI and SAS Enterprise Miner, pp. 1-12. , Paper 044, presented at SAS Global Forum; Protheroe, N., Improving Teaching and Learning with Data-Based Decisions: Asking the Right Questions and Acting on the Answers, , Education Research Centre, 2009 Research Report; Lange, C., Range, B., Welsh, K., (2012) Conditions for Effective Data Use to Improve Schools: Recommendations for School Leaders, , http://cnx.org/content/m45021/latest/, on August, 18, 2013; Turban, E., Sharda, R., Delen, D., (2010) Decision Support and Business Intelligent Systems, , 9th Edition, Prentice Hall, USA; Sarker, F., Davis, H., Tiropanis, T., The role of institutional repositories in addressing higher education challenges (2010) The Second International Workshop on Semantic Web Application in Higher Education, , University of Southampton, UK; Hollingworth, L., Sullivan, A.M., Condon, C., Bhatt, M., Brandt, W.C., (2012) Journal of Research on Leadership Education, 7, p. 78; Ewell, P.T., (2012) Using Information in Higher Education Decision-Making: Modes, Obstacles, and Remedies, , www.spencer.org/resources/content/3/3/8/documents/Ewell-paper.pdf, on August 18, 2013; (2009) Impact of College Rankings on Institutional Decision Making: Four Country Case Studies, , http://www.ihep.org/publications/publications-detail.cfm?id=126, on August, 18, 2013; Abd El-Fattah, M.A., Visual model for managing educational capacity utilization in egyptian universities (2012) Proceedings of International Conference on Information Technology Based Higher Education and Training, pp. 1-4; Conrad, C., Gasman, M., Lundberg, T., Nguyen, T.-H., Commodore, F., Samayoa, A.C., Using Educational Data to Increase Learning, Retention, and Degree Attainment at Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), , A 2013 Research Report of Penn Graduate School of Education, GSE; Kaufman, T., Graham, C.R., Picciano, A.G., Wiley, D., Popham, J.A., Datadriven decision making in the k12 classroom (2014) Handbook of Research on Educational Communications and Technology, pp. 337-346. , edited by J.

Misfortune can be avoided if some precaution is taken. This research hopes to alleviate one from that misery. It also hopes to glean a handsome profit from the stock market with the exception of natural disasters and other unforeseen incidents. Our proposed algorithm uses autoregressive methods to assist with the decision to buy as well as the selling point for any stock price. The proposed algorithm is useful for the shareholder and the trader.

Business process improvement can drastically influence in the profit of corporations and helps them to remain viable. However, the use of traditional Business Intelligence systems is not sufficient to meet today’s business needs. They normally are business domain-specific and have not been sufficiently process-aware to support the needs of process improvement-type activities, especially on large and complex supply chains, where it entails integrating, monitoring and analysing a vast amount of dispersed event logs, with no structure, and produced on a variety of heterogeneous environments. This paper tackles this variability by devising different Big-Data-based approaches that aim to gain visibility into process performance. Design/methodology/approach – Authors present a cloud-based solution that leverages (BD) technology to provide essential insights into business process improvement. The proposed solution is aimed at measuring and improving overall business performance, especially in very large and complex cross-organisational business processes, where this type of visibility is hard to achieve across heterogeneous systems. Findings – Three different (BD) approaches have been undertaken based on Hadoop and HBase. We introduced first, a map-reduce approach that it is suitable for batch processing and presents a very high scalability. Secondly, we have described an alternative solution by integrating the proposed system with Impala. This approach has significant improvements in respect withmapreduce as it is focused on performing real-time queries over HBase. Finally, the use of secondary indexes has been also proposed with the aim of enabling immediate access to event instances for correlation in detriment of high duplication storage and synchronization issues. This approach has produced remarkable results in two real functional environments presented in the paper. Originality/value – The value of the contribution relies on the comparison and integration of software packages towards an integrated solution that is aimed to be adopted by industry. Apart from that, in this paper, authors illustrate the deployment of the architecture in two different settings. © 2015 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business enterprise; Communication technologies; Telecommunications",,,,,,,"(2013) Apache HBase, , http://hbase.apache.org, (accessed 5 April 2014); Becker, J., Matzner, M., Müller, O., Walter, M., A review of event formats as enablers of event-driven BPM (2012) Business Process Management Workshops, 99, pp. 433-445. , Daniel, F., Barkaoui, K. and Dustdar, S.

Recognizing the potential of “big data” to offer new insights for decision making and innovation, panelists at the two events discussed how organizations can use and manage big data for competitive advantage. In addition, expert panelists helped to identify research gaps. While emerging research in the academic community identifies some of the issues in acquiring, analyzing, and using big data, many of the new developments are occurring in the practitioner community. We bridge the gap between academic and practitioner research by presenting a big data analytics framework that depicts a process view of the components needed for big data analytics in organizations. Using practitioner interviews and literature from both academia and practice, we identify the current state of big data research guided by the framework and propose potential areas for future research to increase the relevance of academic research to practice. © 2015 by the Association for Information Systems.","Big data; Business analytics; Business intelligence; Data governance; Data scientist; Decision support; Framework; Unstructured data","Artificial intelligence; Competition; Competitive intelligence; Decision making; Decision support systems; Education; Business analytics; Data governances; Data scientist; Decision supports; Framework; Unstructured data; Big data",,,,,,"Agarwal, R., Dhar, V., Editorial: Big data, data science, and analytics: The opportunity and challenge for IS resesarch (2014) Information Systems Research, 25 (3), pp. 443-448; Andriole, S., Seven indisputable technology trends that will define 2015 (2012) Communications of the Association for Information Systems, 30, pp. 61-72; Aral, S., Dellarocas, C., Godes, D., Introduction to the special issue-social media and business transformation: A framework for research (2013) Information Systems Research, 24 (1), pp. 3-13; (2011) Senior Scholars’ Basket of Journals, , http://aisnet.org/?SeniorScholarBasket, Assocation for Information Systems; Awadallah, A., Graham, D., (2011) Hadoop and the Data Warehouse: When to Use Which (White Paper), , http://www.teradatauniversitynetwork.com, Cloudera and Teradata; Ballard, C., Compert, C., Jesionowski, T., Milman, I., Plants, B., Rosen, B., Smith, H., (2014) Information Governance Principles and Practices for a Big Data Landscape, , http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg248165.html?Open, IBM Redbooks; Barton, D., Court, D., (2012) Making Advanced Analytics Work for You, , https://hbr.org/2012/10/making-advanced-analytics-work-for-you, Harvard Business Review; Basole, R.C., Seuss, C.D., Rouse, W.B., IT innovation adoption by enterprises: Knowledge discovery through text analytics (2013) Decision Support Systems, 54 (2), pp. 1044-1054; Beath, C., Berente, N., Gallivan, M., Lyytinen, K., Expanding the frontiers of information systems research: Introduction to the special issue (2013) Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 14 (4), pp. 1-16; Biesdorf, S., Court, D., Willmott, P., (2013) Big Data: What’s Your Plan?

Among other consequences, digitization and big data analytics reshape business models and impact employment amongst knowledge workers - just as automation did for manufacturing workers. This Viewpoint paper considers the mechanisms underlying how digitization and big data analytics drive the transformation of business and society and outlines the potential effects of digitization and big data analytics on employment - especially in the context of cognitive tasks. Its aim is to outline a critical research agenda to explore and conceptualize evident changes in business models and society arising from these technological advances. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach – The present study adopts a review of extant literature and appreciative enquiry (AI) which is a quasi-ethnographic approach to identify the skills required for BDBA. Findings – The study helps to identify skills for BDBA and based on extant literature and AI, proposes a theoretical framework for education and training for a successful career in BDBA. Further research directions are outlined which can help take the present research to the next level. Research limitations/implications – The paper presents a theoretical framework, but it has to be validated through empirical data. This research will generate a lot of interest to develop a more practical framework and conduct empirical and case study research. Practical implications – The present study has outlined skills for BDBA. The authors have also proposed a theoretical framework which can further help an educational or training institute to embrace the framework to train young undergraduates or graduates to acquire BDBA skills. It may also motivate an institution to structure their curriculum for a BDBA program. Social implications – This research is a timely one to develop necessary skills for being successful in BDBA career and in turn contribute to the well-being of business community and society. Originality/value – This research is a novel one as there is no research done earlier on this new and emerging areas of research, namely, education and training for BDBA. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Appreciative inquiry; Big data and business analytics; Education and training; Framework",,,,,,,"Anderson-Lehman, R., Watson, H.J., Wixom, B.H., Hoffer, J.A., Continental airlines flies high with real-time business intelligence (2004) MIS Quarterly Executive, 3 (4), pp. 163-176; (2012) APICS 2012 big data insights and innovations executive summary, , www.apics.org/docs/industry-content/apics-2012-big-data-executive-summary.pdf, APICS, accessed August 30, 2014; (2014) Big data fatigue?, , http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/big-data-fatigue/, MIT Sloan Review Blog, June 23, accessed September 30, 2014; Chen, H., Chiang, R.H., Storey, V.C., Business intelligence and analytics: From big data to big impact (2012) MIS Quarterly, 36 (4), pp. 1165-1188; Cross, J., Training vs education: A distinction that makes a difference (1996) Bank Securities Journal, , www.internettime.com/Learning/articles/training.pdf, accessed July 15, 2014; Davenport, T.H., Harris, J.G., (2007) Competing on analytics: The New Science of Winning, , Harvard Business Press, Boston, MA; Davenport, T.H., Barth, P., Bean, R., How 'big data 'is different (2012) MIT Sloan Management Review, 54 (1), pp. 43-46; Davenport, T.H., Harris, J.G., Morison, R., (2010) Analytics at Work: Smarter Decisions, , Better Results, Harvard Business Press; Department for Business-Innovation and Skills, (2013) Seizing the data opportunity: A strategy for UK data capability, , www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/34764/12-p120c-guide-to-bis-2012-2013.pdf, accessed August 17, 2014; Katharaki, M., Prachalias, C., Linardakis, M., Kioulafas, K., Business administration training seminar for public sector executives: Implementation and evaluation (2009) Industrial and Commercial Training, 41 (5), pp. 248-257; Kiron, D., Organizational alignment is key to big data success (2013) MIT Sloan Management Review, 54 (3), p. 1; Langley, J.C.J., (2014) 2014 Third-Party logistics study: The state of logistics outsourcing, 56p. , www.capgemini.com/resource-file-access/resource/pdf/3pl_study_report_web_version.pdf, Capgemini Consulting, (accessed August 27, 2014); LaValle, S., Lesser, E., Shockley, R., Hopkins, M.S., Kruschwitz, N., Big data, analytics: And the path from insights to value (2011) MIT Sloan Manage.

The potential downsides are challenges to personal privacy, over-hyped expectations, increasing technological complexity that boggles us. Our point is this change requires scientific discussion from the point of management, leadership and organizations – that is, it is time to discuss the meaning of these challenges seriously also in terms of existing traditions of management science. This review type article discusses the nature and role of the Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data and other key technological waves of ubiquitous revolution vis-á-vis the existing knowledge on management, organizations and knowledge management practices in organizations. Recent changes in the fields of robotics, artificial intelligence and automation technology indicate that all kinds of intelligence and smartness are increasing and organizational cultures are going to change indicating fast changes in the field of modern management and management sciences. Organizational processes form the base for the knowledge-based decision-making. Developing and utilizing smart solutions – like the utilization of Big Data – emphasize the importance of open system thinking. Digitalized services can for instance create new interfaces between service providers and users. Service users create social value while they are participating in co-producing activities. Hence, the IoT and Big Data undoubtedly strengthen the role of participation in service production, service economy, innovativeness in-between organizations (as a joint processes) and leadership models incorporated in service-dominant –logic. Moreover, IoT, Big Data, and especially digitalization bring about the renaissance of knowledge in decision-making. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Big data; Internet of intelligent things; Knowledge management; Leadership; Management; The internet of things","Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Decision making; Internet; Internet of things; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Management; Management science; Robotics; Societies and institutions; Automation technology; Internet of thing (IOT); Knowledge management practices; Knowledge-based decision making; Leadership; Organizational cultures; Organizational process; Technological complexity; Big data",,,,,,"Beck, U., From industrial society to the risk society: Questions of survival, social structure and ecological enlightenment (1992) Theor.

Despite their potential benefits, however, ACOs also raise significant antitrust concerns—concerns that may pit consumer surplus and total surplus against one another. In an attempt to address these concerns, the Department of Justice and Fair Trade Commission announced that they will use market share screens and rule of reason treatment to evaluate ACOs participating in the Medicare Shared Savings Program. The use of market share screens and rule of reason treatment allows the antitrust agencies to avoid prioritizing either consumer surplus or total surplus in the first instance but leaves open two critical questions: What will the rule of reason treatment afforded to ACOs look like? And how will the antitrust agencies ultimately determine whether ACOs benefit or harm consumers? In order to address these questions, this Note proposes that the antitrust agencies use the “big data” collected under the Affordable Care Act to conduct a structured rule of reason review of ACOs that takes into account both the consumer surplus and total surplus through a burden-shifting framework. © 2015 by Shaun E.

E.g; Dorn, supra note 48, at 751. Proponents of the symmetric model have argued that the desire to avoid penalties and receive greater financial rewards provides a more significant incentive for ACOs to lower costs. Id. A third alternative model—partial capitation—is also a possibility. Under this model, an ACO would receive a mix of fee-forservice payments and prospective lump-sum payments that are paid out regardless of the quantity of care provided, thereby creating even greater financial incentives for lowering costs.

(2) Tying sales (either explicitly or implicitly through pricing policies) of the ACO’s services to the private payer’s purchase of other services from providers outside the ACO (and vice versa), including providers affiliated with an ACO participant (e.g., an ACO should not require a purchaser to contract with all of the hospitals under common ownership with a hospital that participates in the ACO). (3) Contracting on an exclusive basis with ACO physicians, hospitals, ASCs, or other providers, thereby preventing or discouraging those providers from contracting with private payers outside the ACO, either individually or through other ACOs or analogous collaborations. (4) Restricting a private payer’s ability to make available to its health plan enrollees cost, quality, efficiency, and performance information to aid enrollees in evaluating and selecting providers in the health plan, if that information is similar to the cost, quality, efficiency, and performance measures used in the Shared Savings Program.

The main outcome of the paper is the definition of an architectural framework and associated research and development agenda for the application of cloud computing for the development and deployment of a Big Data Logistics Business Platform (BDLBP) for supply chain network management services. The capabilities embedded in the BDLBP can provide powerful decision support to logistics networking and stakeholders. Two of the three strategic and operational capabilities as operational capacity planning, and real-time route optimisation are built upon literature based on operational research, and are extended to the scope of dynamic and uncertain situations. The third capability, strategic logistics network planning is currently under researched and this approach aims at covering this capability supported by big data analytics in the cloud. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","3/4PL; Big data; Big data analytics; Big data logistics business platform (BDLBP); Business intelligence; Cloud computing","Chains; Cloud computing; Competitive intelligence; Decision support systems; Distributed computer systems; Information management; Interoperability; Logistics; Network management; Research and development management; Supply chains; Artificial intelligence; 3/4PL; Architectural frameworks; Big data applications; Business platforms; Data analytics; Logistics supply chains; Operational capabilities; Research and development; Big data",,,,,,"Reynalds, S., Supply chain executives weigh in: Investment plans, solution sourcing and implementation challenges (2013) Supply Chain Big Data Report.

To take advantage of this power, we need to create new means of collecting and processing large volumes of data at high speed. Meanwhile, as companies and organizations, such as health services, realize the importance and value of “joined-up thinking” across supply chains and healthcare pathways, for example, this creates a demand for a new type of approach to Business Activity Monitoring and Management. This new approach requires Big Data solutions to cope with the volume and speed of transactions across global supply chains. In this paper we describe a methodology and framework to leverage Big Data and Analytics to deliver a Decision Support framework to support Business Process Improvement, using near real-time process analytics in a decision-support environment. The system supports the capture and analysis of hierarchical process data, allowing analysis to take place at different organizational and process levels. Individual business units can perform their own process monitoring. An event-correlation mechanism is built into the system, allowing the monitoring of individual process instances or paths. © 2015, SciKA.","Big data; Business process improvement; Decision support systems; Processes",,,,,,,"García Peñalvo, F.J., Colomo Palacios, R., Hsu, J.Y., Discovering knowledge through highly interactive information based systems (2013) Journal of Information Science and Engineering, 29, p. 1; Chiang, R.H.L., Goes, P., Stohr, E.A., Business Intelligence and Analytics Education, and Program Development: A Unique Opportunity for the Information Systems Discipline (2012) ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems, 3 (3), pp. 1-12; Philip Chen, C.L., Zhang, C.-Y., Data-intensive applications, challenges, techniques and technologies: A survey on Big Data (2014) Information Sciences, 275, pp. 314-347; Costello, T., Prohaska, B., 2013 Trends and Strategies (2013) IT Professional, 15 (1), p. 64; Borkar, V.R., Carey, M.J., Li, C., Big data platforms: What’s next?

And yet, the concept of big data is one of the most poorly understood terms in business today. The implications for big data analytics are not as straightforward as they might seem-particularly when it comes to the so-called dark data from social media. Increases in the volume of data, the velocity with which they are generated and captured, and the variety of formats in which they are delivered all must be taken into account. To make the best use of the ever-burgeoning store of knowledge and insight at their fingertips, organizational leaders must confront two commonly held fallacies: that methodological issues no longer matter and that big data offers a complete and unbiased source of information on which to base their decisions. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,,"Akoumianakis, D., Karadimitriou, N., Vlachakis, G., Milolidakis, G., Bessis, N., Internet of things as virtual settlements: Insights from excavating social media sites (2012) Proceedings of the 2012 Fourth International Conference on Intelligent Networking and Collaborative Systems, pp. 132-139. , Bucharest, Romania: IEEE Computer Society; Anderson, C., The end of theory: The data deluge makes the scientific method obsolete (2008), http://archive.wired.com/science/discoveries/magazine/16-07/pb_theory, Retrieved July 2015Barnes, N.G., Lescault, A.M., Augusto, K.D., LinkedIn dominates, Twitter trends and Facebook falls: The 2014 Inc. 500 and social media (2014), http://www.umassd.edu/cmr/socialmediaresearch/2015fortune500andsocialmedia, Retrieved August 2015Berners-Lee, T., Fischetti, M., (1999) Weaving the web: The original design and ultimate destiny of the World Wide Web by its inventor, , San Francisco, CA: Harper; Boyd, D., Crawford, K., Critical questions for big data (2012) Information, Communication & Society, 15 (5), pp. 662-679; Global social media check-up 2012 (2012), http://sites.burson-marsteller.com/social/Presentation.aspx, Retrieved July 2015Chen, H., Chiang, R.H.L., Storey, V.C., Business intelligence and analytics: From big data to big impact (2012) MIS Quarterly, 36 (4), pp. 1165-1188; Ekbia, H., Mattioli, M., Kouper, I., Arave, G., Ghazinejad, A., Bowman, T., Suri, V.R., Sugimoto, C.R., Big data, bigger dilemmas: A critical review (2015) Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 66 (8), pp. 1523-1545; (2015) Stats, , http://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/, Retrieved July 2015; Business intelligence (2013), http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/business-intelligence-bi/, Gartner IT Glossary, RetrievedHendler, J., Broad data: Exploring the emerging web of data (2013) Big Data, 1 (1), pp. 18-20; Hurwitz, J., Nugent, A., Halper, F., Kaufman, M., (2013) Big data for dummies, , Hoboken, NJ: Wiley; (2015) Twitter statistics, , http://www.internetlivestats.com/twitter-statistics, July 2015; Johnston, L., How many Libraries of Congress does it take?

New model curriculum is needed that can properly introduce BI and analytics topics into existing curriculum. That curriculum needs to incorporate current big data developments even as new dedicated analytics programs are becoming more prominent throughout the world. This paper contributes to the BI field by providing the first BI model curriculum guidelines. It focuses on adding appropriate elective courses to existing curriculum in order to foster the development of BI skills, knowledge, and experience for undergraduate majors, master of science in business information systems degree students, and MBAs. New curricula must achieve a delicate balance between a topic’s level of coverage that is appropriate to students’ level of expertise and background, and it must reflect industry workforce needs. Our approach to model curriculum development for business intelligence courses follows the structure of Krathwohl’s (2002) revised taxonomy, and we incorporated multi-level feedback from faculty and industry experts. Overall, this was a long-term effort that resulted in model curriculum guidelines. © 2015 by the Association for Information Systems.","Analytics; Big data; Business intelligence; Curriculum development; Model curriculum","Competitive intelligence; Curricula; Education; Education computing; Information analysis; Students; Teaching; Analytics; Business information systems; Business schools; Curriculum development; Data development; Higher education; Master of science; Model curriculum; Big data",,,,,,"Bullen, C., Abraham, T., Galup, S.D., IT workforce trends: Implications for curriculum and hiring (2007) Communications of the Association for Information Systems, 20, pp. 545-554; Chiang, R.H.L., Goes, P., Stohr, E.A., Business intelligence and analytics education, and program development: A unique opportunity for the information systems discipline (2012) ACM Transactions in Management Information Systems, 3 (3), pp. 12:1-12:13; Davenport, T.H., Harris, J.G., (2007) Competing on analytics: The new science of winning, , Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Press; Davenport, T.H., Harris, J.G., The dark side of customer analytics (2007) Harvard Business Review, 85 (5), pp. 37-48; Davenport, T.H., Harris, J.G., Morison, R., (2010) Analytics at work: Smarter decision, better results, , Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Press; Dinter, B., Goul, M., Gupta, B., (2012) Facing the challenges of ""big data"": Towards model curriculum for business intelligence in undergraduate and graduate IS and MBA programs, , Paper presented at the Proceedings of the Business Intelligence Conference 3, Orlando, Florida; Field, A., Testing, monitoring, and adjusting strategic objectives through data analytics at Northwestern Mutual (2011) Balanced Scorecard Report, 13 (1), pp. 7-10; Gorgone, J., Gray, P., Stohr, E.A., Valacich, J.S., Wigand, R.T., MSIS 2006: Model curriculum and guidelines for graduate degree programs in information systems (2006) Communications of the Association for Information Systems, 17 (1), pp. 121-196; Herschel, R., (2011) Business intelligence, MS and MBA., , http://www.b-eye-network.com/view/14854, BeyeNetwork.

In particular, computing environment of enterprise is changing largely due to cloud computing and big data. Utilization value of big data is expanded across all sectors of society of administration, welfare transportation, health care, finance, manufacturing, etc. and the importance of big data as a driving force of the national economy is increased. In Korea, it is estimated that there is lack of professional staff, and a technology gap with developed countries although it is expected that demand of technology and professional staff will increase rapidly because big data is a source of future competitive advantage. In this paper, we identify concept and organization of big data business ecosystem and analyze the development step of the ecosystem. In particular, we investigated features by step of the big data business and analyzed systematically the development direction accordingly. The analyzed result in this paper is utilized to many companies and related policies of big data and will provide a number of advantages. © 2015 SERSC.","Big data; Business ecosystem; Data analysis; Data mining; Data utilizing","Competition; Data mining; Data reduction; Ecology; Ecosystems; Business ecosystem; Competitive advantage; Computing environments; Data utilizing; Developed countries; Development directions; National economy; Wireless terminals; Big data",,,,,,"Robins, G., Pattison, P., Kalish, Y., Lusher, D., An Introduction to Exponential Random Graph (p*) Models for Social Networks (2007) Social Networks, 29 (2), pp. 173-191; Wactlar, H., Pavel, M., Barkis, W., Can Computer Science Save Healthcare?

Researchers and policymakers thus need a clear picture of digital businesses, but conventional datasets and typologies tend to lag real-world change. We use innovative 'big data' resources to perform an alternative analysis for all active companies in the UK, focusing on ICT-producing firms. Exploiting a combination of observed and modelled variables, we develop a novel 'sector-product' approach and use text mining to provide further detail on key sector-product cells. We find that the ICT production space is around 42% larger than SIC-based estimates, with around 70,000 more companies. We also find ICT employment shares over double the conventional estimates, although this result is more speculative. Our findings are robust to various scope, selection and sample construction challenges. We use our experiences to reflect on the broader pros and cons of frontier data use. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In the Era of Big Data, former and robust analytical concepts and utilities need to adapt themselves to the changed market circumstances. The main focus of this work is to address the acceleration of building process of a “data-centric” Business Intelligence (BI) solution besides preparing BI solutions for Big Data utilization. This research addresses the following goals: reducing the time spent during business intelligence solution’s design phase; achieving flexibility of BI solution by adding new data sources; and preparing BI solution for utilizing Big Data concepts. This research proposes an extension of the existing Extract, Load and Transform (ELT) approach to the new one Extract, Load, Transform and Analyze (ELTA) supported by service-orientation concept. Additionally, the proposed model incorporates Service-Oriented Architecture concept as a mediator for the transformation phase. On one side, such incorporation brings flexibility to the BI solution and on the other side; it reduces the complexity of the whole system by moving some responsibilities to external authorities. © 2015, SciKA.","BI; Big data; Business intelligence; ELT; ELTA; ETL; SOA",,,,,,,"Negash, S., Business intelligence (2004) The Communications of the Association for Information Systems, 13 (1), p. 54; Porter, M.E., Advantage, C., (2008) Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance, 1St Ed.

Nowadays we are entering in to the next digitally enriched generation of social media and enabled by thrilling, currently under extensive development technologies, like Big Data, Cloud Computing, Virtual/Augmented Reality and Internet of Things. To our understanding the new generation of social media and the integrated business models that will support them are within a converging area where social features and ubiquitous technologies are met. Social elements, related to behavior, self-esteem, attachment and other psychological dimensions of personality will be transparently integrated to a number of technologies. Thus for the next years we have to wait for a number of new applications and systems, all targeted in a meta-existence level where the characteristics of human identity will be mixed with various digital identity elements. This basic trend and direction in the Social Media research in the next decade will boost the transparency of technologies and will stimulate an extremely different Web than the one we are exploiting together.

For mining the useful information from the network big data, it is required to efficiently organize the data resources in the cyberspace and realize the semantic-based similarity search. For an efficient data organization and search, we firstly need to extract the features/attributes of the big data to construct its high-dimensional semantic space, then define the data resources and queries as feature vectors or high-dimensional points in the semantic space, and finally can calculate the semantic similarity by the distance of high-dimensional points or the cosines of the angles between feature vectors. The multidimensional indexes can efficiently organize data resources in the semantic space, realizing the semantic-based similarity search. In addition, the dimensionality reduction technology can avoid the effects of “curse of dimensionality” when the dimensionality of the semantic space is too high. In this paper, the existing multidimensional indexes and dimensionality reduction technologies are reviewed systematically. Moreover, the existing semantic-based similarity search technologies using distributed technology are analyzed, and some suggestions about future research work are discussed. ©, 2014, Science Press.

The market demand is modeled as an end-of-line virtual machine based on which the market demand dissatisfaction (MDD) can be measured as production loss using event-based analysis. A general Markovian continuous-flow model is developed for market demand-driven systems with multistage production networks combining manual and automatic processes. Machine failure bottlenecks (MF-BNs) and machine capacity bottlenecks (MC-BNs) are defined and identified based on event-based indicators. A supervisory control algorithm is integrated in the framework to reduce MDD and improve system productivity through identification and mitigation of MF-BNs and MC-BNs. Simulation-based analysis will also be utilized, and case studies are performed to validate the effectiveness of the modeling framework and the supervisory control policies. © 2014 IEEE.","Markovian continuous flow; Modeling; Multi-stage production system; Supervisory control","Algorithms; Manufacture; Models; Continuous flows; Data-driven model; Multi-stage production systems; Multi-stage productions; Simulation-based analysis; Supervisory control; System productivity; Virtual machines; Commerce",,,,,"CMMI-1351160, NSF, National Science Foundation","Li, Y., Chang, Q., Xiao, G., Biller, S., Event-based modelling of distributed sensor networks in battery manufacturing (2014) Int.

What we already know is that MI is influenced by a large number of process variables, such as the process temperature, pressure, and level of liquid, and a large amount of their data are routinely recorded by the distributed control system. An alternative data-driven model was explored to online predict the MI, where the least squares support vector machine was responsible for establishing the complicated nonlinear relationship between the difficult-to-measure quality variable MI and those easy-to-measure process variables, whereas the independent component analysis and particle swarm optimization technique were structurally integrated into the model to tune the best values of the model parameters. Furthermore, an online correction strategy was specially devised to update the modeling data and adjust the model configuration parameters via adaptive behavior. The effectiveness of the designed data-driven approach was illustrated by the inference of the MI in a real polypropylene manufacturing plant, and we achieved a root mean square error of 0.0320 and a standard deviation of 0.0288 on the testing dataset. This proved the good prediction accuracy and validity of the proposed data-driven approach. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Manufacturing; Synthesis and processing; Theory and modeling","Distributed parameter control systems; Independent component analysis; Manufacture; Mean square error; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Polypropylenes; Propylene; Social networking (online); Statistical tests; Least squares support vector machines; Non-linear relationships; Online correction strategies; Particle swarm optimization technique; Propylene polymerization; Root mean square errors; Synthesis and processing; Theory and modeling; Quality control",,,,,,"Bafna, S.S., Beall, A.M., (1997) J.

Methods/Statistical analysis: The methodology adopted in this activity is applying outlier analysis which is a data mining technique. The inter quartile range findings and analysis has been used here to find the hidden useful information from the process data with which a better insight could be established towards the improvement of quality of the product. The data used here have been collected from the automotive engine assembly and testing process. The study compares the results between the conventional and outlier analysis. Findings: The conventional style of checking and approving the engines based on the value pattern of Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC) which uses the design specification comparison with the actual data generally yields very minimal scope for the improvement of product quality in the perspective of design, Safety and reliability of the product because of the adherence of the same design specifications of the part drawings supplied by various suppliers. The competitive automotive manufacturing domain demands a different approach with which a better scope could be identified towards the improvement of product quality which is undoubtedly data mining. The outlier analysis using inter quartile range on the sample data of 500 engines revealed many important aspects where the improvement scope for quality has been identified as 15,000 Parts Per Million (PPM) against400 PPM of conventional quality analysis for the same data. Improvement/Application: This research is to offer an inclusive model hypothetically with actual data both for engineering and management people of manufacturing domain about the insights and benefits of employing data mining techniques towards the improvement of product quality with proven results.","Automotive engine testing; Data mining; Inter quartile range; Manufacturing quality; Outlier analysis",,,,,,,"Raggatt, P.R., Duplicates or singletons?-an analysis of the need for replication in immunoassay and a computer program to calculate the distribution of outliers, error rate and the precision profile from assay duplicates (1989) Annals of Clinical Biochemistry: An international journal of biochemistry in medicine., 26 (1), pp. 26-37; Hawkins, D., Identification of outliers (1980), Chapman and Hall LondonAnscombe, F.J., Rejection of Outliers (1960) Techno Metrics., 2, pp. 123-147; Barnett, V., Lewis, T., Outliers in statistical data (1994), 3rd edition.

Due to advances in data collection systems and analysis tools, data mining (DM) has widely been applied for quality assessment (QA) in manufacturing industries. In DM, the choice of technique to be used in analyzing a dataset and assessing the quality depend on the understanding of the analyst. On the other hand, with the advent of improved and efficient prediction techniques, there is a need for an analyst to know which tool performs better for a particular type of dataset. Although a few review papers have recently been published to discuss DM applications in manufacturing for QA, this paper provides an extensive review to investigate the application of a special DM technique, namely support vector machine (SVM) to deal with QA problems. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the literature from various points of view as DM concepts, data preprocessing, DM applications for each quality task, SVM preliminaries, and application results. Summary tables and figures are also provided besides to the analyses.

Transitions between process execution steps are therefore case specific and depend on independent judgment of case workers. In this paper, we propose an instance-specific probabilistic process model (PPM) whose transition probabilities are customized to the semi-structured business process instance it represents. An instance-specific PPM serves as a powerful representation to predict the likelihood of different outcomes. We also show that certain instance-specific PPMs can be transformed into a Markov chain under some non-restrictive assumptions. For instance-specific PPMs that contain parallel execution of tasks, we provide an algorithm to map them to an extended space Markov chain. This way existing Markov techniques can be leveraged to make predictions about the likelihood of executing future tasks. Predictions provided by our technique could generate early alerts for case workers about the likelihood of important or undesired outcomes in an executing case instance. We have implemented and validated our approach on a simulated automobile insurance claims handling semi-structured business process. Results indicate that an instance-specific PPM provides more accurate predictions than other methods such as conditional probability. We also show that as more document data become available, the prediction accuracy of an instance-specific PPM increases. © 2013, Springer-Verlag London.","Business process; Data driven; Decision tree; Markov chain; Prediction",,,,,,,"Cook, J.E., Wolf, A.L., Discovering models of software processes from event-based data (1998) ACM Trans Softw Eng Method, 7 (3), pp. 215-249; Gartner (2010) report; Curbera, F., Doganata, Y.D., Martens, A., Mukhi, N., Slominski, A., Business provenance—a technology to increase traceability of end-to-end operations (2008) OTM conferences, 1, pp. 100-119; Datta, A., Automating the discovery of AS-IS business process models: probabilistic and algorithmic approaches (1998) Inf Syst Res, 9 (3), pp. 275-301; Feller, W., An introduction to probability theory and its applications, vol 1.

Firstly, we present the theoretical framework for data clustering on small business dataset. It is based on a construction of a hierarchical rough set approximation in an information system for data splitting. The hierarchy is defined by the notion of a nested sequence of indiscernibility relations that can be defined from the dependency of attributes. Secondly, an application of such hierarchy for mining maximal association from a business transactional data is presented. It is shown that the dependency provides clear and provable theoretical approach for data clustering and maximal association rules mining. © 2015 SERSC.","Data clustering; Dependency of attributes; Hierarchical rough set approximation; Maximal association rules mining; Rough set theory","Approximation algorithms; Association rules; Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Information systems; Rough set theory; Data clustering; Dependency of attributes; Indiscernibility relation; Maximal association; Maximal association rules; Rough set approximation; Theoretical approach; Theoretical framework; Data mining",,,,,,"Herawan, T., Deris, M.M., 'Rough Set Theory for Topological Spaces in Information Systems' (2009) Modelling & Simulation, , AMS, Third Asia International Conference; Herawan, T., Deris, M.M., 'A Construction of Nested Rough Set Approximations in Information Systems Using Dependency of Attributes' (2009) Power Control and Optimization: Proceedings of the Second Global Conference on Power Control and Optimization; Pawlak, Z., 'Rough sets' (1982) International Journal of Computer & Information Sciences', 11, pp. 341-356; Pawlak, Z., (1991) Rough sets: Theoretical aspects of reasoning about data, 9. , Springer Science & Business Media; Pawlak, Z., Skowron, A., 'Rudiments of rough sets' (2007) Information sciences, 177, pp. 3-27; Ziarko, W., (1991) 'The discovery, analysis and representation of data dependencies in databases', , Regina: Department of Computer Science, University of Regina; Ziarko, W., Shan, N., 'Discovering attribute relationships, dependencies and rules by using rough sets' (1995) 46th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences; Ziarko, W., 'Dependencies in structures of decision tables' (2007) Rough Sets and Intelligent Systems Paradigms, pp. 113-121. , ed: Springer; Düntsch, I., Gediga, G., 'Statistical evaluation of rough set dependency analysis' (1997) International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 46, pp. 589-604; Düntsch, I., Gediga, G., 'Algebraic aspects of attribute dependencies in information systems' (1997) Fundamenta Informaticae, 29, pp. 119-133; Herawan, T., Deris, M.M., 'A framework on rough set-based partitioning attribute selection' (2009) Emerging Intelligent Computing Technology and Applications.

Service offers companies significant opportunities to create and capture economic value. Firms are increasingly focusing on how they can deliver services that help their customers deliver value. Service providers are shifting from being ‘doers’ to becoming ‘problem solvers’, capable of orchestrating the delivery of complex services. ABC, a product manufacturing company is moving from a product manufacturer to a product-service system (PSS). However, the shift from a product to a PPS system is not trivial. This case study shows how the use of the product data analytics service (PDAS) model can help companies who are contemplating using Big Data to provide competitive services. Understanding what is happening in the shift to services is vital to the future success of all product companies.

This paper develops a holistic, theoretically-grounded and practically relevant business analytics capability framework (BACF) that specifies, defines and ranks the capabilities that constitute an organisational BA initiative. The BACF was developed in two phases. First, an a priori conceptual framework was developed based on the Resource- Based View theory of the firm and a thematic content analysis of the BA literature. Second, the conceptual framework was further developed and refined using a three round Delphi study involving 16 BA experts. Changes from the Delphi study resulted in a refined and confirmed framework including detailed capability definitions, together with a ranking of the capabilities based on importance. The BACF will help academic researchers and industry practitioners to better understand the capabilities that constitute an organisational BA initiative and their relative importance. In future work, the capabilities in the BACF will be operationalised to measure their as-is status, thus enabling organisations to identify key areas of strength and weakness and prioritise future capability improvement efforts. © 2015 Cosic, Shanks & Maynard.","Business analytics; Business analytics capability framework; Delphi study; Resource-based view; Thematic content analysis",,,,,,,"Anderson-Lehman, R., Watson, H.J., Wixom, B.H., Hoffer, J.A., Continental Airlines Flies High with Real-Time Business Intelligence (2004) MISQ Executive, 3 (4), pp. 163-176; Allmendinger, G., Lombreglia, R., Four Strategies for the Age of Smart Services (2005) Harvard Business Review, 83 (10), pp. 131-145; Aral, S., Weill, P., IT Assets.

In this study, we have tried to identify quantitative difference in user registrations and factors for the difference using web analytics. We have observed and analysed web form in context and in its content perspectives. The analysis in context includes change in registration procedure and number of steps.

Organizations require effective approaches to evaluate their BIA capabilities in order to develop strategies for their evolution. In this paper, we employ a design science paradigm to develop a comprehensive BIA effectiveness diagnostic (BIAED) framework that can be easily operationalized. We propose that a useful BIAED framework must assess the correct factors, should be deployed in the proper process context and acquire the appropriate input from different constituencies within an organization. Drawing on the BIAED framework, we further develop an online diagnostic toolkit that includes a comprehensive survey instrument. We subsequently deploy the diagnostic mechanism within three large organizations in North America (involving over 1500 participants) and use the results to inform BIA strategy formulation. Feedback from participating organizations indicates that the BIA diagnostic toolkit provides insights that are essential inputs to strategy development. This work addresses a significant research gap in the area of BIA effectiveness assessment. © 2015 Foshay, Yeoh, Boo, Ong & Mattie.","BIA strategy formulation; Business intelligence and analytics (BIA); Diagnostic framework",,,,,,,"Arnott, D., Pervan, G., Design science in decision support systems research: An assessment using the Hevner, March, Park, and Ram Guidelines (2012) Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 13 (11), pp. 923-949; Barrett, D., Barton, N., Best practices in building a data warehouse quickly (2006) Business Intelligence Journal, 11 (4), pp. 37-45; Brooks, P., El-Gayar, O., Sarnikar, S., A framework for developing a domain specific business intelligence maturity model: Application to healthcare (2015) International Journal of Information Management, 35, pp. 337-345; Bucher, T., Gericke, A., Sigg, S., Process-centric business intelligence (2009) Business Process Management Journal, 15 (3), pp. 408-429; Cates, J.E., Gill, S.S., Zeituny, N., The Ladder of Business Intelligence (LOBI): a framework for enterprise IT planning and architecture (2005) International Journal of Business Information Systems, 1 (1), pp. 220-238; Chrissis, M.B., Konrad, M., Shrum, S., (2011) CMMI for Development: Guidelines for Process Integration and Product Improvement, , Addison-Wesley Professional; Chuah, M.-H., Wong, K.-L., A review of business intelligence and its maturity models.""

As a result of this shift, the legacy metrics and KPIs which were once used to scale and understand respectively the performance of the industry need to evolve as per needs of the new environment to provide a more accurate picture of the industry as it undergoes a business transformation. As a result of shift from voice to data there is a change in the business trends in the telecom industry which in turn necessitates the need for new Key Perfomance Indicators to measure the performance of the telecom industry. So the objective of the paper is to study the changes happening in the telecom industry due to the shift of voice from data and the effect of this shift on the telecom business trends. The paper attempts to come up with new key performance indicators which will help the telecom managers' scale the usage and revenue generated by data services more accurately.","Business transformation; Business trends; KPI; Legacy metrics",,,,,,,"(2013), International Mobile Roaming Services-ITU(2013), Pwc, Internet Access(2013), Global Mobile Statistics(2013), Informa(2014), Deloitte, short messaging services(2013), Ernst&Young(2013), Ernst&Young(2013), GSMA Mobile Economy(2012), Silverstreet(2012), BT FuturesOvum(2012), Hong Leong Investment Bank(2013), Mckinsey&Co(2012), Deloitte(2012), Hong Leong Investment Bank(2013), Cisco VNI",,,,"Indian Society for Education and Environment",,,,,09746846,,,,"English","Indian J.

These programmes target the development of products that will not be sold for several years; therefore, one of the risks is that the products will no longer be in demand or will have been overtaken by more advanced technologies. In several cases, the authors have seen these programmes fail because the intended targets of the programme did not apply to use the programme funds (poorly targeted program) or did not use the programme properly. An integrated programme involving foresight, competitive intelligence and business analytics assists in decreasing the probability of the risks and problems described above, resulting in better designed and more successful industrial policy. These techniques can also be used to create a dashboard for monitoring programme use so that any problems can be corrected early on. The dashboard uses advanced analytics to assess programme applications and programme inquiries to assess whether the programme is being used properly.

Effective supply chain performance through supply chain antecedents such as business analytics has become a potentially valuable way of securing competitive advantage and improving supply chain performance. Many organizations have begun to recognize that supply chain management is the key to building a sustainable competitive advantage for their products or services in an increasingly crowded marketplace. Despite the fact that, determining supply chain performance through its antecedents is considered as a unique methodology, theoretical and comprehensive studies on supply chain performance through the methodology is few and far between. This study addressed the lack of the empirical studies by developing a comprehensive model to examine the effect of plan analyse, source analyse, make analyse and delivery analyse on supply chain performance considering moderating effect of WS on the relationships. A quantitative methodology using a cross-sectional survey method was used to investigate the relationship between variables. Data were collected from automotive companies in Iran. The overall response rate was 86.72%. The relationships between variables were examined using structural equation modelling (SEM) technique and partial least squares (PLS) software was used to examine the proposed hypotheses. The results revealed there is a significant and positive relationship between four areas of business analytics namely plan analyse, source analyse, make analyse and delivery analyse and supply chain performance. Moreover, the results indicated that the aforementioned relationship is moderated by WS. The study combined resource- based theory, resource dependence theories to develop a new theoretical framework to demonstrate the importance of the four areas of SCOR approach businesses analytic; in improving supply chain performance. Moreover, the study has provided a new platform to effectively improve supply chain performance. © 2005 - 2015 JATIT & LLS.

Design/methodology/approach – A two-step research approach is applied. In step one, the available literature is screened and evaluated, and this is followed by ten semi-structured expert interviews. With that input, a conceptual software pricing model is designed. In step two, this model is validated and refined through discussions with representatives of the five leading business intelligence suites. Findings – The paper sheds light on the value perception of customers and suggests a clear focus on the interaction between customers and vendors, and less on technical issues. The developed customer-centric, value-based pricing framework helps to improve pricing techniques and strategies. Research limitations/implications – The research is focused on the pricing strategy of software houses and excludes differentiations of technical specifications and functionalities. Practical implications – The research can support practitioners in the field of BI&A in rethinking their pricing methods. Placing the customer at center stage can lead to lower customer churn rates, higher customer satisfaction and more pricing flexibility. Originality/value – This empirical study reveals the importance of a customer-centric pricing approach in the specific case of BI&A.

As a pedagogical subject, BI/BA is still in its infancy, and, in order for this to mature, we need to develop an undergraduate model BI/BA curriculum. BI/BA as an academic domain is emerging as a hybrid of disciplines, including information systems, statistics, management science, artificial intelligence, computer science, and business practice/theory. Based on IS 2010’s model curriculum constructs (Topi et al., 2010), we explore two curricular options: a BI/BA concentration in a typical IS major and a comprehensive, integrated BI/BA undergraduate major. In support, we present evidence of industry need for BI/BA, review the current state of BI/BA education, and compare anticipated requirements for BI/BA curricula with the IS 2010 model curriculum. For this initial phase of curricular design, we postulate a preliminary set of knowledge areas relevant for BI/BA pedagogy in a multidisciplinary framework. Then we discuss avenues for integrating these knowledge areas to develop professionally prepared BI/BA specializations at the undergraduate level. We also examine implications for both AACSB and ABET accreditation and describe the next phase of applying the IS 2010 concept structure to BI/BA curriculum development. © 2015 by the Association for Information Systems.","AACSB; ABET; Accreditation; Analytics; Business intelligence; IS 2010; Model curriculum","Accreditation; Artificial intelligence; Competitive intelligence; Curricula; Information analysis; Information management; Management science; AACSB; ABET; Analytics; Business analytics; Curriculum development; Model curriculum; Strategic objectives; Undergraduate curricula; Education",,,,,,"(2014) Accreditation Policy and Procedure Manual, , http://www.abet.org/wpcontent/uploads/2015/05/C001-15-16-CAC-Criteria-03-10-15.pdf, ABET; Alavi, M., Leidner, D., Knowledge management and knowledge management systems: Conceptual foundations and research issues (2001) MIS Quarterly, 25 (1), pp. 107-136; Alter, S., Markus, M., Scott, J., Vessey, I., Does the trend toward e-business call for changes in the fundamental concepts of information systems?

Since the data structure is increasingly complicated in a fully automated wafer fabrication facility, it is difficult to diagnose the whole production system for fault detection. A number of approaches have been proposed for fault diagnosis and root cause detection. However, many constraints in real settings restrict the usage of conventional approaches, due to the big data with complicated data structure. In particular, a batch may not be considered as a run in the present sub-batch processing system for wafer fabrication, in which the processing paths of the wafers in a batch could be different. Motivated by realistic needs, this paper aims to develop a root cause detection framework for the sub-batch processing system. Briefly, the proposed framework consists of three phases: data preparation, data dimension reduction, and the sub-batch processing model construction and evaluation. The proposed approach has been validated by a sequence of simulations and an empirical study conducted in a leading semiconductor manufacturing company in Taiwan. The results have shown practical viability of the proposed approach. Indeed, the developed approach is incorporated in the engineering data analysis system in this case company. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","big data analytics; data mining; longitudinal data analysis; root cause detection; Sub-batch processing system","Big data; Competition; Data handling; Data mining; Data structures; Fault detection; Information analysis; Manufacture; Manufacturing data processing; Semiconductor device manufacture; Silicon wafers; Batch processing system; Competitive advantage; Data analytics; Data dimension reduction; Engineering data analysis; Longitudinal data; Root cause; Semiconductor manufacturing; Batch data processing",,,,,"NSC100-2628-E-007-017-MY3, MOST, Ministry of Science and Technology; NSC103-2622-E-007-002, MOST, Ministry of Science and Technology","Chien, C.-F., Chen, Y.-J., Peng, J.-T., Manufacturing intelligence for semiconductor demand forecast based on technology diffusion and product life cycle (2010) Int.

Where is the business and decision-making value in this technology? What does such market growth say about the emerging use of big data in society? Let's attempt an overview of the variety of business cases made on behalf of big data. Perhaps after doing so we can gain clearer insight into who is using big data and how big data contributes value. An overview of the discussion suggests there are three distinct arguments, and a number of distinct variations within these arguments. We take a look at each of these arguments, treating each of these arguments as a thought experiment about the role of big data in society. Then we evaluate the respective merits of each argument in light of where actual expenditure seems to be occurring. © 1973-2011 IEEE.",,"Decision making; Business case; Computing technology; Market growth; Thought experiments; Big data",,,,,,,,,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,,,,03608581,,IEMRA,,"English","IEEE Eng Manage Rev",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84915819430

Critical race theory (CRT) allows for an analysis regarding the nature of these beliefs about race and indicates the need for school administrators to engage the realities of the community members they serve, rather than merely enacting technical-rational administrative behaviors that serve to continue regimes of marginalization and oppression. © The Author(s) 2013.","African American students; culturally relevant pedagogy; racism; social; subjects; urban; urban education",,,,,,,"Arriaza, G., Making changes that stay made: School reform and community involvement (2004) The High School Journal, 87 (4), pp. 10-24; Bell, D.A., (1998) Afrolantica Legacies, , Chicago, IL: Thirdworld Press; Blair, M., Whiteness as institutionalized racism as conspiracy: Understanding the paradigm (2008) Educational Review, 60, pp. 249-251; Crenshaw, K., Gotanda, N., Peller, G., Thomas, K., (1995) Critical Race Theory: Key Writings that Formed the Movement, , New York, NY: New Press; Creswell, J.W., (2003) Research Design: Qualitative, Quantitative, and Mixed Methods Approaches, , (2nd ed.).

This paper explores ways of integrating big data insights with automated and assisted processes related to key customer touchpoints to ultimately improve the customer experience. We show how innovation from Alcatel-Lucent and Bell Labs helps CSPs improve their business performance, using unique methodology designed to select the right key quality indicators, build accurate key business objective ""formula,"" predict customer behavior, and ultimately understand which factors are influencing the most. This can be used for example to improve the Net Promoter Score (NPS).

Big data means piles accumulated from converging platforms such as computing infrastructures, smart devices, social networking and new media, and big data is also an analytic technique itself. Numerous enterprises have grown conscious that big data can be a most significant resource or capability since the issue of big data recently surfaced abruptly in Korea. Companies will be obliged to design their own implementing plans for big data marketing and to customize their own analytic skills in the new era of big data, which will fundamentally transform how businesses operate and how they engage with customers, suppliers, partners and employees. This research employed a Q-study, which is a methodology, model, and theory used in 'subjectivity' research to interpret professional panels' perceptions or opinions through in-depth interviews. This method includes a series of q-sorting analysis processes, proposing 40 stimuli statements (q-sample) compressed out of about 60 (q-population) and explaining the big data marketing model derived from in-depth interviews with 20 marketing managers who belong to major companies(q-sorters). As a result, this study makes fundamental contributions to proposing new findings and insights for small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) and policy makers that need guidelines or direction for future big data business. © 2014 KSII.","BI&A; Big data; Business intelligence; Marketing; Q methodology; Subjectivity study","Analytic technique; Big datum; Computing infrastructures; In-depth interviews; Marketing manager; Q methodology; Small and medium-size enterprise (SMEs); Subjectivity study; Commerce; Competitive intelligence; Industry; Marketing; Population statistics; Social sciences computing; Sorting",,,,,,"Pang, B., Lee, L., Opinion mining and sentiment analysis (2008) Foundations and Trends In Information Retrieval, 2 (1), pp. 1-135. , Article (CrossRef Link); (2012) The Journey to Big Data, , EMC Corporation; (2012) The 2011 IBM Tech Trends Report: The Clouds Are Rolling In, is Your Business Ready, , IBM, November; Manyika, J., Chui, M., Brown, B., Bughin, J., Dobbs, R., Roxburgh, C., Byers, A.H., (2011) Big Data: The Next Frontier For Innovation, Competition, and Productivity; Davenport, T.H., Competing on analytics (2006) Harvard Business Review, 84 (1), pp. 98-107; Chen, H., Chiang, R.H., Storey, V.C., Business intelligence and analytics: From big data to big impact (2012) MIS Quarterly, Special Issue: Business Intelligence Research, 36 (4), pp. 1165-1188; (2012) Big Data Unleashed, , Informatica; Brown, S.R., (1986) Q Technique and Method: New Tools For Social Scientists, , W.D.

Because of the nature of the emerging issue of drug safety, it is common for policy makers and healthcare professionals to make decisions without sufficient evidence. Big data may be used as an efficient pharmacovigilance tool, which enables us to recognize adverse drug reactions that may not have been identified in pre-marketing clinical trials, in order to capture the patterns of drug utilization and adverse events, and to predict the occurrence of adverse drug reactions. National surveillance systems using electronic health databases have been established successfully in the US and Europe. The Korea Institute of Drug Safety and Risk Management (KIDS) plans to establish a big data platform for pharmacovigilance in Korea.

Our purposes are to: (1) analyze the common practice and use of educational data in postsecondary education institutions and identify challenges as the educational crossroads; (2) propose the concept of Data Literacy (DL) for teaching (Mandinach &Gummer, 2013a) and its relevance to researchers and stakeholders in postsecondary education; and (3) provide future implications for practices and research to increase educational DL among administrators, practitioners, and faculty in postsecondary education.Design/methodology/approach-We used two guiding conceptual frameworks to analyze the common practice and use of educational data in postsecondary education institutions and identify challenges as the educational crossroads. First, we used the 4Vs of Big Data by Rajan (2012) to examine the misalignment between the policy mandate and the practices. The elements of the 4Vs of Big Data-volume, velocity, variety, and veracity-help us to depict how Big Data enables educators to organize, store, manage, and manipulate vast amounts of educational data at the right moment and at the right time. Second, we used the conceptual framework for DL proposed by Gummer and Mandinach (in press). They interpret DL ""as the collection, examination, analysis, and interpretation of data to inform some sort of decision in an educational setting"" (p. 1, in press).Findings-Using the guiding frameworks, we identified four educational data crossroads as follows: Crossroad 1: Unintended Increase in Workload Volume; Crossroad 2: Unrealistic Expectations of Data Velocity; Crossroad 3: Data Variety in Silos; and Crossroad 4: Data Veracity and Policy Agenda Mismatch. In this paper, we explain each of these crossroads in more detail with some examples. Originality/value of the paper-Much of the existing body of literature, exemplary practices, as well as federal and state funding has been focused on K-12 education contexts. In this paper, we identify current practices and challenges of educational data in the institutions of higher education. Additionally, this paper presents the application of the exemplary practices of data literacy development in postsecondary education and implications for future practices of data literacy development in postsecondary education. © 2014 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.","College completion; Community college; Data analytics; Data driven decision making; Data literacy; Student success",,,,,,,"(2002) Public Law, pp. 107-110. , http://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/esea02/107-110.pdf, NCLB Act.

Thematic maps of the 11 hydrological/hydrogeological factors i.e., geomorphology, soil, topographic elevation, slope, drainage density, proximity to surface waterbodies, pre- and post-monsoon groundwater depths, net recharge, transmissivity, and land use/land cover, influencing the groundwater occurrence were used. The themes and their features were assigned suitable weights, which were normalized by the MCDM technique. Finally, the knowledge-driven groundwater potential map, generated by weighted linear combination, revealed that the good, moderate and poor groundwater potential zones are spread over 90.94 km2 (26 %), 135 km2 (39 %) and 122.36 km2 (35 %), respectively. Furthermore, the data-driven precise groundwater potential index (GPI) map was computed by MLR technique. The results of both the knowledge- and data-driven approaches were validated from the well yields of 18 sites and were found to be comparable to each other. Moreover, exogenous and endogenous factors affecting the good, moderate and poor groundwater potential were identified by applying principal component analysis. The results of the study are useful to water managers and decision makers for locating appropriate positions of new productive wells in the study area.

Decisions are often made with few local empirical data. We demonstrated the use of the robust decision making approach in Los Angeles County, an approach that is data driven and allows decision makers to compare the performance of various intervention strategies across thousands of simulated future scenarios. We found that the prevailing strategy of emphasizing behavioral risk reduction interventions was unlikely to achieve the policy goals of the national HIV/AIDS strategy. Of the alternative strategies we examined, those that invested most heavily in interventions to initiate antiretroviral treatment and support treatment adherence were the most likely to achieve policy objectives.

Here, policymakers collect and analyze data to make their operations more efficient and equitable. Progress in bringing the benefits of D3M to everyday life has been slow. For example, a student asks, ""If I pursue an undergraduate degree at this university, what are my expected lifetime earnings?"". Presently there is no principled way to search for this, be-cause an accurate answer depends on the student and school. Such queries are personalized, winnowing down large datasets for specific circumstances, rather than applying welldefined predicates. They predict decision outcomes by extrapolating from relevant examples. This vision paper introduces a new approach to D3M that is designed to empower the individual to make informed choices.

We also establish some desirable properties of this operator, such as commutativity, idempotency and monotonicity. Then, we apply the induced interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy Einstein ordered weighted average (I-IVIFEOWA) operator based on the data mining to deal with multiple attribute decision making under interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy environments. Finally, an illustrative example about selecting an ERP system is given to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness. © 2014 - IOS Press and the authors.

Another way to look at big data is by the method of its collection. The satellite looks at patterns of clouds and ocean currents and other measurements of the earth, such as oxygen levels in the ocean. There are a lot of records that are created by the analog computer. One place to start is by looking at clickstream data where there is some business value.

The difference between big data (BD) and traditional business intelligence (BI) is also heavily discussed among practitioners and scholars. We conduct a latent semantic analysis (LSA) on job advertisements harvested from the online employment platform monster.com to extract information about the knowledge and skill requirements for BD and BI professionals. By analyzing and interpreting the statistical results of the LSA, we develop a competency taxonomy for big data and business intelligence. Our major findings are that (1) business knowledge is as important as technical skills for working successfully on BI and BD initiatives; (2) BI competency is characterized by skills related to commercial products of large software vendors, whereas BD jobs ask for strong software development and statistical skills; (3) the demand for BI competencies is still far bigger than the demand for BD competencies; and (4) BD initiatives are currently much more human-capital-intensive than BI projects are. Our findings can guide individual professionals, organizations, and academic institutions in assessing and advancing their BD and BI competencies. © Springer Fachmedien 2014.","Big data; Business intelligence; Competencies; Latent semantic analysis; Text mining",,,,,,,"Barney, J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage (1991) J Manage, 17, pp. 99-120; Buhl, H.U., Interview with Martin Petry on ""Big data"" (2013) Bus Inf Syst Eng, 5, pp. 101-102; Buhl, H.U., Röglinger, M., Moser, F., Heidemann, J., Big data (2013) Bus Inf Syst Eng, 5, pp. 65-69; Burton, B., Geishecker, L., Hostmann, B., (2006) Organizational Structure: Business Intelligence and Information Management, pp. 1-11; Casey, T., Krishnamurthy, K., Abezgauz, B., Who should own big data?

It is particularly difficult to ensure high yields because the products are made through sequential nano-scale processes, and the quality of each process may be affected by the results of the upstream processes. This type of cumulative effect makes it difficult to determine the machines that introduce product faults. In this paper, we develop a data mining approach to which large amounts of trace data are inputted to infer fault-introducing machines in the form of a L ⇒ R rule, where R contains the fault type and L contains a machine sequence that is the primary cause of the fault type. We tested our approach with industrial lot trace data collected from a PCB manufacturing line with 33 machines and six fault types. From the work-site experiment, we found 26 composite rules that showed a significant cumulative effect. The average fault detection accuracy of the rules was 87.2%. In addition, we found 13 rules that affected more than one fault type. © 2014 Korean Society for Precision Engineering and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Bayesian network; Causal analysis of product fault; Cumulative effect; Fault rule mining; Multi-stage manufacturing line; Partial least-squares regression",,,,,,,"Shang, Y., Tsung, F., Zou, C., Statistical Process Control for Multistage Processes with Binary Outputs (2013) IIE Transactions, 45 (9), pp. 1008-1023; Montgomery, D.C., (2009) Introduction to Statistical Quality Control, pp. 288-506; Agrawal, R., Srikant, R., Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules (1994) Proc.

The project addressed a major operational resource allocation challenge that is typical to the industry. We study the resource allocation problem in which some of the tasks are scheduled and known in advance, and some are unpredictable and have to be addressed as they appear. The utility has maintenance crews that perform both standard jobs (each must be done before a specified deadline) as well as respond to emergency gas leaks (that occur randomly throughout the day and could disrupt the schedule and lead to significant overtime). The goal is to perform all the standard jobs by their respective deadlines, to address all emergency jobs in a timely manner, and to minimize maintenance crew overtime. We employ a novel decomposition approach that solves the problem in two phases. The first is a job scheduling phase, where standard jobs are scheduled over a time horizon. The second is a crew assignment phase, which solves a stochastic mixed integer program to assign jobs to maintenance crews under a stochastic number of future emergencies. For the first phase, we propose a heuristic based on the rounding of a linear programming relaxation formulation and prove an analytical worst-case performance guarantee. For the second phase, we propose an algorithm for assigning crews that is motivated by the structure of an optimal solution. We used our models and heuristics to develop a decision support tool that is being piloted in one of the utility's sites. Using the utility's data, we project that the tool will result in a 55% reduction in overtime hours. © 2014 INFORMS.","Gas pipeline maintenance; Optimization; Resource allocation; Scheduling; Stochastic emergencies; Utility","Decision support systems; Integer programming; Linear programming; Maintenance; Optimization; Resource allocation; Scheduling; Decision support tools; Decomposition approach; Linear programming relaxation; Mixed-integer programs; Pipeline maintenance; Resource allocation problem; Stochastic emergencies; Utility; Stochastic systems",,,,,"CMMI-1162034, NSF, National Science Foundation","Ahmed, S., Two-stage stochastic integer programming: A brief introduction (2010) Wiley Encyclopedia of Operations Research and Management Science, 8. , Cochran JJ, Cox LA, Keskinocak P, Kharoufeh JP, Smith JC, eds, John Wiley & Sons, New York; Birge, J.R., Stochastic programming computation and applications (1997) INFORMS J.

As such, it serves as an initial ontology for business analytics as a field of study. The foundation has three main parts dealing with the whence and whither of business analytics: identification of dimensions along which business analytics possibilities can be examined, derivation of a six-class taxonomy that covers business analytics perspectives in the literature, and design of an inclusive framework for the field of business analytics. In addition to unifying the literature, a major contribution of the designed framework is that it can stimulate thinking about the nature, roles, and future of business analytics initiatives. We show how this is done by deducing a host of unresolved issues for consideration by researchers, practitioners, and educators. We find that business analytics involves issues quite aside from data management, number crunching, technology use, systematic reasoning, and so forth. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Analytics; Business analytics; Business intelligence; Decision making; Decision support; Evidence-based","Competitive intelligence; Decision making; Decision support systems; Information management; Management science; Analytics; Business analytics; Decision supports; Evidence-based; Technology use; Education",,,,,,"Kalakota, R., (2011) Gartner Says - BI and Analytics A $12.2 Bln Market, , http://practicalanalytics.wordpress.com/2011/04/24/gartner-says-bi-and- analytics-a-10-5-bln-market/, Posted April 24, 2011; Elliot, T., (2012) 2012: The Year Analytics Means Business, , http://smartdatacollective.com/timoelliott/45868/2012-year-analytics- means-business, Posted February 10, 2012; Kalakota, R., (2011) IBM CIO Study: BI and Analytics Are #1 Priority for 2012, , http://practicalanalytics.wordpress.com/2011/11/02/ibm-cio-study-bi-and- analytics-are-1-priority-for-2012/, Posted November 2, 2011; Harris, D., (2012) IDC: Analytics A $51B Business by 2016 Thanks to Big Data, , http://gigaom.com/cloud/idc-analytics-a-51b-business-by-2016-thanks-to- big-data/, Accessed Jul 11, 2012; Swoyer, S., Demand for analytics keeps growing (2012) The Data Warehouse Institute, , http://tdwi.org/articles/2012/09/18/Demand%20Analytics%20Grows.aspx, (Posted September 18, 2012.); Research, N., Analytics pays back $10.66 for every dollar spent (2011) Report L122; Lacugna, J., Foreword (2013) Big Data and Business Analytics, , J.

In addition to the constraints that traditional medical facilities face, vRad is subject to supply and demand requirements that are unique to the teleradiology business environment. In this paper, we present a forecasting and capacity-planning model that more accurately assesses demand and plans system capacity to provide better service to vRad's customers. We discuss the underlying reasons for improvement and quantify the impact on vRad's entire system. We explain managerial insights that will help both vRad and other companies in the service sector with similar service-response requirements and demand patterns.

This lack of understanding is especially significant in IT-Enabled Services (IESs) and IES innovation. Much work is needed to understand the contemporary trend of integrating diverse material and social resources to address complex organizational and individual needs. This article proposes a novel framework for IES and IES innovation and develops propositions and implications for research and practice. This work draws upon the tenet of complexity theory and conceptualizes IES as complex adaptive systems (CAS), with such properties and behaviors as diverse adaptive elements, nonlinear interaction, self-organization, and adaptive learning, and IES innovation as a co-evolutionary process of variation, selection, and retention (VSR). The proposed framework is illustrated using business analytics (BA) as a new kind of decision support service (DSS) throughout this paper. Several propositions are developed. Finally, we present a discussion and implications. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Business analytics; Complexity theory; IT-enabled services; Service innovation; Service-oriented decision support systems","Business analytics; Complexity theory; IT-enabled services; Service innovation; Service Oriented; Artificial intelligence; Competition; Computational complexity; Decision support systems; Information technology",,,,,,"Aldrich, H., (2006) Organizations and Environments, , 2nd ed.

Understanding customer behavior is a vital in examining firms the marketplace. The purpose of this study is to examine of the use of marketing analytics to measure customer behavior in small business enterprises (SME). The study used three hypotheses to guide the direction of the research. Building on key theoretical concepts grounded in accounting, finance and marketing literature, this study used analytics to measure both customer behavior and firm behavior patterns. This study examined three significant marketing analytics: (a) customer behavior analytics (customer turnover/frequency; velocity of profit/payment for services); (b) marketing behavior analytics (potential of product/services; economic conditions); and economic behavior analytics (pricing adjustment; market barriers). A random sample (N = 198) of businesses were examined for the study. A quantitative methodology was used to examine data collected from the businesses. The results were calculated using a discriminant analysis and a Pearson's Correlation. Based on the results of the study, the marketing behavior analytic proved to be moderately significant in predicting customer behavioral patterns.",,,,,,,,"Acker, O., Gröne, F., Blockus, A., Bange, C., In-memory analytics - strategies for real-time CRM (2011) Journal of Database Marketing & Customer Strategy Management, 18 (2), pp. 129-136; Afifi, A., Clark, V., (1984) Computer-Aided Multivariate Analysis., , Belmont, CA: Lifetime Learning Publications; Allen, J., Yen, W., (1979) Introduction to Measurement Theory., , Belmont, CA: Wadsworth; Ambler, T., Kokkinaki, F., Puntoni, S., Assessing marketing performance: Reasons for metrics selection (2004) Journal of Marketing Management, 20 (3-4), pp. 475-498; Ayres, I., (2007) Super Crunchers: Why Thinking By Numbers Is The New Way To Be Smart., , New York: Bantam; Azam, Z., Qamar, I., Quantifying the role of marketing productivity metrics in marketing performance measurement (2011) Interdisciplinary Journal of Contemporary Research in Business, 3 (4), pp. 428-440; Babbie, E., (1973) Survey Research Methods., , Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Publishing; Bailey, C., Baines, P.R., Wilson, H., Clark, M., Segmentation and customer insight in contemporary services marketing practice: why grouping customers is no longer enough (2009) Journal of Marketing Management, 25 (3-4), pp. 227-252; Bednall, D., Effective research (2012) Australasian Journal of Market & Social Research, 20 (1), p. 8; Berger, A., Cowan, A., Frame, W.W., The surprising use of credit scoring in small business lending by community banks and the attendant effects on credit availability, risk, and profitability (2011) Journal of Financial Services Research, 39 (1-2), pp. 1-17; Brooks, N., Simkin, L., Measuring marketing effectiveness: An agenda for SMEs (2011) Marketing Review, pp. 3-24; Buffett, M., Clark, D., (1997) Buffettology., , New York: Rawson Associates; Buffett, W., Cunningham, L., (2001) The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America, , (2nd ed.).

However, Chinese senior manager's ingrained guanxi-based decision making practices are considered the largest obstacle of the BI system diffusion to local enterprises. In the current research, we perform a comparison between business intelligence-based decision making philosophies (i.e., business analytics) and guanxi-based decision making philosophies in four dimensions: 1) the key player dimension; 2) the business practice dimension; 3) the time orientation dimension; 4) the performance measurement dimension. After the comparative study, we offer several propositions to practitioners in order to find the possibilities of introducing business analytics to Chinese enterprises that have been strongly influenced by guanxi networks.

As more healthcare systems capture information electronically and begin to collect more novel forms of data, such as human DNA, how will we leverage these resources and use them to improve human health at a manageable cost? In this article, we argue that analytics will play a fundamental role in the transformation of the American healthcare system. However, there are numerous challenges to the application and use of analytics: the lack of data standards, barriers to the collection of high-quality data, and a shortage of qualified personnel to conduct such analyses. There are also multiple managerial issues, such as how to get end users of electronic data to employ it consistently to improve healthcare delivery and how to manage the public reporting and sharing of data. In this article, we explore applications of analytics in healthcare, barriers and facilitators to its widespread adoption, and ways in which analytics can help us achieve the goals of the modern healthcare system: high-quality, responsive, affordable, and efficient care. © 2014 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.","Analytics; Healthcare; Information technology",,,,,,,"(2012), http://www.mwvaardex.com/Products/DataCollection/index.htm, Aardex Group.

However, the method usually generates a large number of association rules; and it is difficult to use domainindependent objective measures to help find pragmatically important rules. To address these issues, we present a general method that succinctly summarizes rules with common consequent(s). This consequent-based approach allows user to focus on evaluating a rule set based on the practical significance of consequent(s) in an application domain, which usually outweighs the importance of objective measures such as rule confidence. We provide a case study to demonstrate how the proposed method can be used in conjunction with a heuristic procedure to find important rules generated from large real-world data, leading to discovery of important business knowledge and insights. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.",,"Association rules; Data mining; Business analytics; Business knowledge; Data mining methods; General method; Heuristic procedures; Market basket analysis; Objective measure; Rule confidences; Heuristic methods",,,,,,"Agrawal, R., Imielinski, T., Swami, A., Mining Associations Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases (1993) Proc.

However, social network analysis is difficult due to issues in data collection, natural language processing, social network detection and construction, relationship mining, etc. Thus, we develop the Corporate Leaders Analytics and Network System (CLANS) to tackle some of these problems. Our contributions are in three aspects: 1) we collect data from multiple sources and do the preprocessing to make it available to use; 2) we construct a business social network and formulate the similarity relations among individuals and corporations; 3) we conduct further data mining to discover more implicit information, including important entities finding, relation mining and shortest path finding. In this paper, we present the overview of CLANS and specifically address these three major issues. We have made an operational system and achieved basic functionalities. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","Business analytics; Business elites; China market; Corporations; Data mining; Social network","Data acquisition; Distributed computer systems; Industry; Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); Business analytics; China markets; Implicit informations; NAtural language processing; Network detections; Operational systems; Shortest path findings; Similarity relations; Data mining",,,,,,"Allen, F., Qian, J., Qian, M., Law, finance, and economic growth in China (2005) Journal of Financial Economics, 77 (1), pp. 57-116; Deerwester, S.C., Dumais, S.T., Landauer, T.K., Furnas, G.W., Harshman, R.A., Indexing by latent semantic analysis (1990) JASIS, 41 (6), pp. 391-407; Eddy, S.R., Profile hidden markov models (1998) Bioinformatics, 14 (9), pp. 755-763; King, I., Li, J., Chan, K.T., A brief survey of computational approaches in social computing (2009) IJCNN, pp. 1625-1632. , IEEE; Larcker, D., Richardson, S., Seary, A., Tuna, A., (2005) Back Door Links between Directors and Executive Compensation; Larcker, D.F., So, E.C., Wang, C., Boardroom centrality and stock returns (2010) Citeseer; Lau, T.P., Wang, S., Man, Y., Yuen, C.F., King, I., Language technologies for enhancement of teaching and learning in writing (2014) Proceedings of the Companion Publication of the 23Rd International Conference on World Wide Web Companion, pp. 1097-1102. , International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee; Manning, C.D., Raghavan, P., Schütze, H., (2008) Introduction to Information Retrieval, 1. , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Mo, M., King, I., Exploit of online social networks with community-based graph semi-supervised learning (2010) ICONIP 2010, Part I.

Professional consultancies and software houses are both touting it as the next wave in business, claiming that the need for BA skills is large and growing. Universities are beginning to respond by offering undergraduate majors and minors, Master of Science degrees, certificates, and concentrations within their Master of Business Administration programs. But what subjects are being covered in these programs? We surveyed some of the largest, most established, and best-known programs (predominantly in the United States, but some international) and interviewed representatives of these programs to better understand the requirements for students entering, the required and elective course topics covered, and job opportunities for graduates. In this article, we summarize our findings and provide some conclusions about analytics programs, including the current landscape, suggestions for development, and our vision for the future. We believe this report is useful to institutions that offer analytics programs, to those considering such offerings, and to the employers who are hiring analytics professionals. These employers need to better understand the skills that professionals are acquiring. Finally, it should help prospective students who seek to understand the analytics programs being offered to find the best match for their skills and interests. © 2014 INFORMS.","Analytics programs; Bachelor of Science; Benchmarking; Certificate; Curriculum; Master of Science",,,,,,,"Bialik, C., (2013) Data Crunchers Now the Cool Kids on Campus, , Wall Street Journal (March 1) A2; Davenport, T.H., Harris, J.G., (2007) Competing on Analytics: The New Science of Winning, , (Harvard Business Review Press, Cambridge, MA); Harris, J., (2010) Competing on Analytics., , http://www.youtube.com/watch?vDlSBtOBHjhGg, Accessed October 1, 2013; (2013) Candidate Handbook, , http://www.informs.org/Certification-Continuing-Ed/Analytics- Certification/Candidate-Handbook#1g, INFORMS, Accessed March 24, 2014.

Firms need to understand both the opportunity and the potential of business analytics. Reporting, which is getting a handle on what happened in organizations, is complemented by analytics that is rather explanatory and predictive. Leveraging business analytics means to use analytics applications in order to analyse business problems and produce related business recommendations to improve business process performance. Business analytics must but be a part of a value creating process operating together with other systems and organisational factors in a synergistic manner, including people, processes, knowledge and relationship assets, culture, structure, and policies. In order for companies to be efficient, they need to automate processes, workflows and make rules. Effectiveness, on the other hand, is about making better decisions, perhaps using the same data that their competitors may have. What matters is not necessarily the technologies deployed, but emerging competence that the firm uses to support its business. A specific ""mindset"" needs to be installed for companies to invest into business analytics. Organisations need to better understand how best to exploit their data and convert them into information and sense-making capabilities. Business capabilities can be enhanced not only by exploitation of analytical tools, but also by the sophisticated use of information. This leads to a truly sense-making capability or ""analytical mindset"". The primary data covers 398 data sets, where firms have been asked about the specifics of their information management. The data is used as input to statistical tests and the value of business analytics is being analyzed in an empirical way.","Analytical capabilities; Big data; Business analytics; Business intelligence; Business objectives; Competitive advantage; Enterprise performance; Predictive analytics; Value creation",,,,,,,"Arnott, D., Pervan, G., Eight key issues for the decision support systems discipline (2008) Decision Support Systems, 44 (3), pp. 657-672. , ISSN 0167-9236; Davenport, T.H., Harris, J.G., Morison, R., (2010) Analytics at Work, pp. 6-8. , Boston, MA, USA: Harvard Business School Publishing, ISBN 978-1-422-17769-3; Dhillon, G., Organizational competence for harnessing IT: A case study (2008) Information & Management, 45 (5), pp. 297-303. , ISSN 0378-7206; Evelson, B., (2008) The Forrester Wave: Enterprise Business Intelligence Platforms Q3 2008, , http://www.sas.com/news/analysts/forresterwave_bi_0708.pdf, Forrester Research, Published on: July 31, 2008.

Using advanced analytics methods and emerging technologies - such as business intelligence systems, business activity monitoring, predictive analytics, behavioral pattern recognition, and 'type simulations' - can help business users continuously improve their processes. However, the high volumes of event data produced by the execution of processes during the business lifetime prevent business users from efficiently accessing timely analytics data. This article presents a technological solution using a big data approach to provide business analysts with visibility on distributed process and business performance. The proposed architecture lets users analyze business performance in highly distributed environments with a short time response.

Methods - This article presents the results of a single case study conducted in the Special and Digital Collections department at a university library. The department created an holistic assessment model, taking into account both public and technical services, to explore inter-related questions affecting both day-to-day operations as well as long-term, strategic priorities. Results - Data from a variety of assessment activities positively impacted the department's practices, informing decisions made about staff skill sets, training, and scheduling; outreach activities; and prioritizing technical services. The results provide a comprehensive view of both patron and department needs, allowing for a wide variety of improvements and changes in staffing practices, all driven by data rather than anecdotal evidence. Conclusion - Although the data generated for this study is institutionally specific, the methodology is applicable to special collections departments at other institutions. A systemic, holistic approach to assessment in special collections departments enables the implementation of operational efficiencies. It also provides data that allows the department to document its value to university-wide stakeholders. © 2013 Griffin, Lewis, and Greenberg.",,,,,,,,"Abraham, T., Balzarini, S.E., Frantilla, A., What is backlog is prologue: A measurement of archival processing (1985) American Archivist, 48 (1), pp. 31-44; Metrics and assessment task force (2013), http://wwwrbms.info/committees/task_force/metrics_assessment/index.shtml, ACRL Rare Books and Manuscripts Section.

A major problem is the high volume of business process datasets with characteristics such as high dimensionality, noise, uncertainty in process datasets and complicated interactions among process variables. Data mining (DM) techniques facilitate the identification and analysis of business processes, and improve their performance by extracting the hidden knowledge in business process datasets. In this paper, we present the application of DM to BPR, based on two novel approaches. By a literature review, the first approach proposes DMbBPR model, mainly focuses on the applications of data mining to each BPR phase. The second approach presents a novel combinational model based on the knowledge management cycle and CRISP-DM process in the framework of process monitoring architecture. To achieve better results, both approaches should be considered simultaneously in order to effectively identify, analyse, and improve business processes.

Wafer fabrication in the semiconductor industry is one of the most complex manufacturing processes. For such highly complicated operations, maintaining high yields through the statistical process control as a sole monitoring method for quality control is obviously inefficient. We thus investigate the intelligent and semi-automatic technique to help industrial engineers analyzing their production data. Our proposed method has the ability to induce patterns that can reveal and differentiate low performance processes from the normal ones. We also provide program coding of the proposed sequence analysis method, implemented with the R language, for easy experimental repetition.","Intelligent manufacturing; Performance pattern; R programming language; Sequence analysis; Sequence data mining","Complex manufacturing process; Intelligent Manufacturing; Performance analysis; Performance patterns; Semiconductor industry; Sequence analysis; Sequence-data mining; Wafer manufacturing; Industrial engineering; Manufacture; Production engineering; Semiconductor device manufacture; Statistical process control; Data mining",,,,,,"SETFI: Manufacturing data: Semiconductor tool fault isolation, Causality Workbench Repository (2008), http://www.causality.inf.ethz.ch/repository.php, AA&YA, Intel, [Online] AvailableChen, T., An evolving fuzzy-neural rule with slack diversification for enhancing job dispatching (2012) International Journal of Grid and Distributed Computing, 5 (2), pp. 1-8; Chen, T., Wang, Y., Estimating the job cycle time in wafer fabrication with distributed sensors (2012) International Journal of Hybrid Information Technology, 5 (12), pp. 81-88; Gabadinho, A., Ritschard, G., Studer, M., Muller, N., Extracting, and rendering representative sequences (2011) in A.

METHOD: 596 episodes of care that included pain as a problem on a patient's care plan were examined using statistical and data mining tools. The data were extracted from the Hands-On Automated Nursing Data System database of nursing care plan episodes (n=40,747) coded with NANDA-I, Nursing Outcomes Classification, and Nursing Intervention Classification (NNN) terminologies. System episode data (episode=care plans updated at every hand-off on a patient while staying on a hospital unit) had been previously gathered in eight units located in four different healthcare facilities (total episodes=40,747; EOL episodes=1,425) over 2 years and anonymized prior to this analyses. RESULTS: Results show multiple discoveries, including EOL patients with hospital stays (<72hr) are less likely (p<.005) to meet the pain relief goals compared with EOL patients with longer hospital stays.

This information is used in analysis, trade and scenario studies, and ultimately decision making. In this paper, the concept of visual analytics is explored as an enabler to facilitate rapid, defensible and superior decision making. By coupling analytical reasoning with the exceptional human capability to rapidly internalize and understand visual data, visual analytics allows individual and collaborative decision making to occur in the face of vast and disparate data, time pressures and uncertainty. An example visual analytics framework is presented in the form of a decision-making environment centered on the Lockheed C-5A and C-5M aircraft. This environment allows rapid trade studies to be conducted on design, logistics and capability within the aircraft's operational roles. Through this example, the use of a visual analytics decision-making environment within a military environment is demonstrated. © 2011 The Society for Modeling and Simulation International.","Analytical reasoning; C-5A; C-5M; Decision making; Network enabled capability; Trade studies; Visual analytics","Analytical reasoning; C-5A; C-5M; Network-enabled capabilities; Trade-study; Visual analytics; Aircraft; Commerce; Military applications; Visualization; Decision making",,,,,,"Michell, S., (2009) Understanding Network Enabled Capability, , London: Newsdesk Communications, Ltd; Lyman, P., Varian, H.R., (2003) How Much Information?, , http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/how-much-info, accessed 7 July 2010; A Tradecraft Primer: Structured Analytic Techniques For Improving Intelligence Analysis, , https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/index.html, Central Intelligence Agency: Center for the Study of Intelligence, March 2009, accessed 17 July 2010; Thomas, J.J., Cook, K.A., (2005) Illuminating the Path: The R&D Agenda For Visual Analytics, , National Visualization and Analytics Center, Richland, WA, USA; (2004) The 9/11 commission report, , National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States (Zelikow P (Executive Director), Jenkins BD (Counsel) and May ER (Senior Advisor)).

Accurate and robust cost models can help to provide significant competitive advantage for manufacturing organisations. Advanced computational methods such as virtual manufacturing and data mining have been identified as potentially powerful techniques for generating cost models that bypass the problems associated with traditional cost modelling processes. Part I, of this two-part paper, described the development of a cost model development methodology that makes use of virtual manufacturing models and data mining techniques and used case study data to validate this methodology. A critical part of this methodology is the selection and use of effective data analysis techniques that can identify accurate and robust cost estimating relationships. Part II now examines in detail the effectiveness of alternative data mining algorithms in terms of their ability to develop relationships that are (1) representative of the real causal relationships that exist and (2) able to provide a high level of estimating accuracy. More specifically, it focuses on the data generated by virtual manufacturing models and how the size and complexity of the generated data sets impact the accuracy of the cost estimating relationships. © 2012 Springer-Verlag London Limited.","Cost model development; Data mining; Process time estimating; Virtual manufacturing","Competitive advantage; Cost estimating relationships; Cost models; Data analysis techniques; Data mining algorithm; Manufacturing organisations; Process time; Virtual manufacturing; Agile manufacturing systems; Algorithms; Competition; Cost estimating; Data mining; Graphical user interfaces; Cost benefit analysis",,,,,,"Asakawa, N., Takeuchi, Y., Teachingless spray-painting of sculptured surface by an industrial robot (1997) Proceedings of the 1997 IEEE, International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 1875-1879. , Albuquerque, New Mexico; Balakin, K.V., Savchuk, N.P., Advanced data mining technologies (2004) Manuf Chem, 75 (7), pp. 31-33; Bode, J., Neural networks for cost estimation: Simulations and pilot application (2000) Int J Prod Res, 38 (6), pp. 1231-1254. , 0944.90528 10.1080/002075400188825; Bode, J., Ren, S., Shi, Z., Application of 3-layer perceptrons to cost estimation (1995) Proceedings of the 1995 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks, pp. 1749-1762. , ISSN: 0-7803-2768-3; Boothroyd, G., Reynolds, C., Approximate cost estimates for typical turned parts (1989) J Manuf Syst, 8 (PART 3), pp. 185-193. , ISSN: 0278-6125; Buchner, A.G., Anand, S.S., Hughes, J.G., Data mining in manufacturing environments: Goals, techniques and applications (1997) Stud Informat Contr, 6 (4), pp. 319-328. , ISSN 1220-1766; Choudhary, A.K., Harding, J.A., Popplewell, K., Knowledge discovery for moderating collaborative projects (2006) IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics, pp. 519-524; Cochran, E.B., Using regression techniques in cost analysis Part 2 (1976) Int J Prod Res, 14 (4), pp. 489-511. , 10.1080/00207547608956620; Creese, R.C., Adithan, M., Pabla, B.S., (1992) Estimating and Costing for the Metal Manufacturing Industries, p. 120. , Marcel Dekker New York; Denton, J., Hung, M., A comparison of nonlinear optimization methods for supervised learning in multilayer feedforward neural networks (1996) Eur J Oper Res, 93, pp. 358-368. , 0912.90253 10.1016/0377-2217(96)00035-5; Dysert, L.R., Developing a parametric model for estimating process control costs (1999) AACE International Transactions, pp. Est011-Est014. , ABI/INFORM Global, Morgantown; Fazel, F.A., Ouyang, J., Data mining: Understanding data and disease modeling (2003) IASTED International Multi-Conference on Applied Informatics, 21, pp. 32-37; Giudici, P., (2003) Applied Data Mining: Statistical Methods for Business and Industry, , John Wiley, ISBN: 0470846798; Graham, P., Fuzzy logic and neural nets: Still viable after all these years?

Such models provide information that is critical to all stages of the product development process and to ensuring that development of cost-effective product design and production methods. Use of virtual manufacturing models and data mining techniques enables the majority of the activities involved in the cost model development process to be automated. Hence, reducing the time and effort required, reducing the current high level of reliance on expert judgment and enabling higher levels of cost detail to be estimated. The research reported, therefore, focuses on the use of virtual manufacturing to generate datasets which are then analysed using data mining to identify suitable cost models for manufacturing processes. Part I, of this two-part paper, describes the development of a model development methodology that makes use of virtual manufacturing models and data mining techniques and uses case study data to validate this methodology. Part II will then examine in detail the effectiveness of alternative data mining algorithms in terms of their ability to develop relationships that are (1) representative of the real causal relationships that exist and (2) provide a high level of estimating accuracy. © 2012 Springer-Verlag London Limited.","Cost model development; Data mining; Process time estimating; Virtual manufacturing","Causal relationships; Cost models; Data mining algorithm; Manufacturing process; Process time; Product development process; Production methods; Virtual manufacturing; Agile manufacturing systems; Algorithms; Data processing; Estimation; Graphical user interfaces; Industrial engineering; Product design; Production engineering; Research; Data mining",,,,,,"Apgar, H., Developing the cost estimating model (2003) AIAA Space 2003 Conference & Exposition, 2. , 23-25 Sept 03 AIAA-2003-6343, Long Beach, California; Asakawa, N., Takeuchi, Y., Teachingless spray-painting of sculptured surface by an industrial robot (1997) Proceedings of the 1997 IEEE, International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 1875-1879. , Albuquerque, New Mexico; Baguley, P., (2004) Improving the Cost Model Development Process Using Fuzzy Logic, , Thesis (Ph.D) - De Montfort University, Leicester; Dauda, M., Roy, R., Stephenson, D.J., Development of a cost model for high efficiency deep grinding (HEDG) (2005) ICMR2005: 3rd International Conference on Manufacturing Research Incorporating the 21st National NCMR, , Gao JX, Baxter D, Sackett P (eds) Cranfield University, U.K; Delgado, Y., McNeill, M., Stockton, D.J., Improving the cost model development procedure (2002) 2002 AACE International Transactions, pp. EST14. , Chicago; Endo, J., Ohba, S., Anzai, T., Virtual manufacturing for sheet metal processing (1996) J Mater Process Technol, 60, pp. 191-196. , 10.1016/0924-0136(96)02327-8; Iwata, K., Onosato, M., Teramoto, K., Osaki, S., Virtual manufacturing systems as advanced information infrastructure for integrating manufacturing resources and activities (1997) CIRP Ann Manuf Technol, 46 (1), pp. 335-338. , 10.1016/S0007-8506(07)60837-3; Jayaram, S., Connacher, H.I., Lyons, K.W., Virtual assembly using virtual reality techniques (1997) Comput Aided des, 29 (8), pp. 575-584. , 10.1016/S0010-4485(96)00094-2; Klein, R., A new tool for improving spray gun transfer efficiency (2002) Met Finish, 100 (8), pp. 34-41; Lee, W.B., Cheung, C.F., Li, J.G., Applications of virtual manufacturing in materials processing (2001) J Mater Process Technol, 113, pp. 416-423. , 10.1016/S0924-0136(01)00668-9; Mackenzie, D., Cost estimating relationship regression variance study (2003) AIAA Space 2003 Conference and Exposition, 2. , 23-25 Sept 03 AIAA-2003-6297, Long Beach, California; Needy, K.L., Billo, R.E., Warner, R.C., A cost model for the evaluation of alternative cellular manufacturing configurations (1998) Comput Ind Eng, 34 (1), pp. 119-134. , 10.1016/S0360-8352(97)00155-1; Randal, S.Z., Accurate estimate start with clear pictures (1996) Trans AACE Int CS101; Rohrer, M.W., Seeing is believing: The importance of visualization in manufacturing simulation (2000) Proceedings of the 2000 Winter Simulation Conference, pp. 1211-1216. , Bountiful, UT, U.

A woman's body type changes significantly with age, especially during elderly age. Elderly aged women are a significant customer group because of their interest in apparel matched by an increase in financial abilities. However, most apparel currently marketed is produced based on the younger women, and does not reflect the elderly aged body types. Standard elderly aged size charts are crucial standards for apparel industries. However, these industries suffering from production often find it hard to obtain the elderly aged standards. This study aims to fill the gap by proposing an ANN-based data mining framework to generate useful patterns for developing standard size charts. By conducting an empirical study, the results can provide apparel industries with standard size charts for women to improve manufacturing competitiveness. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","anthropometric data;

The experience of Intel and IBM engineers with big scientific and research databases also confirms that columnar data is much easier to compress. DB2 with BLU Acceleration uses advanced encoding for extreme compression. That translates to faster analytics, because it means more data can fit into main memory on the database server, where the server's processors can access it quickly.

However, little DDDM reform has happened at the classroom level, and little research has explored variables that influence teacher adoption of DDDM. The authors propose a model in which teachers sense of efficacy for the skills that support classroom-level DDDM and DDDM anxiety significantly influenced teachers DDDM efficacy, which then influenced collaboration concerns that influenced refocusing concerns. The authors used structural equation modeling to analyze data on 537 teachers in order to validate this hypothesized model.

Although DDDM is not a new paradigm in education, little is known about what variables facilitate teacher adoption of DDDM practices. The aim of this work was to introduce two such variables, DDDM efficacy and DDDM anxiety, and a measure of these constructs, the DDDM efficacy and anxiety (3D-MEA) inventory. The 1728 participants in this study were K-12 teachers who had experienced varying levels of DDDM professional development in a Pacific Northwestern state. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) (n= 864) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) (n= 864) were utilized to evaluate the psychometric properties of the 3D-MEA Inventory.

Any error or disorder in facilities and processes can cause a catastrophic failure. To avoid such failures, a zero- defect manufacturing (ZDM) system is necessary in order to increase the reliability and safety of manufacturing systems and reach zero-defect quality of products. One of the major challenges for ZDM is the analysis of massive raw datasets. This type of analysis needs an automated and self-organized decision making system. Data mining (DM) is an effective methodology for discovering interesting knowledge within a huge datasets. It plays an important role in developing a ZDM system. The paper presents a general framework of ZDM and explains how to apply DM approaches to manufacture the products with zero-defect. This paper also discusses 3 ongoing projects demonstrating the practice of using DM approaches for reaching the goal of ZDM. © 2013 Shanghai University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Data mining (DM); Knowledge discovery; Quality of product; Zero- defect manufacturing (ZDM)",,,,,,,"Arumugam, V., Antony, J., Douglas, A., Observation: a lean tool for improving the effectiveness of lean six sigma (2012) TQM J, 24 (3), pp. 275-287; Halpin, J.F., (1996) Zero Defects: A New Dimension in Quality Assurance, , New York: McGraw-Hill; Crosby, P.B., (1979) Quality is Free: The Art of Making Qualify Certain, , New York: McGraw Hill; Calvin, T.W., Quality control techniques for ""zero defects (1983) IEEE Trans Compon Hybrids Manuf Technol, 6, pp. 323-328; Calvin, T.W., Quality control techniques for ""Zero Defects (1983) IEEE Trans Compon Hybrids Manuf Technol, 6, pp. 323-328; Wang, K., Applying data mining to manufacturing: the nature and implications (2007) J Intell Manuf, 18 (4), pp. 487-495; Wang, K., (2005) Applied Computational Intelligence in Intelligent Manufactruing Systems, , Adelaide: Advanced Knowledge International; Baragoin, C., Andersen, C.M., Bayerl, S., (2001) Mining Your Own Business in Health Care Using DB2 Intelligent Miner for Data, , California: IBM Redbook; Marishin, A.D., Stasenko, I.K., Operating experience of pump manufacturing plants using the zero-defect system (1970) Khimieheskoei Neftyanoe Mashinostroenie, pp. 44-46; Alpern, P., Nelle, P., Barti, E., On the way to zero defect of plastic-encapsulated electronic power devices-Part I: metallization (2009) Device Mater Reliab, 9, pp. 269-278; Alpern, P., Nelle, P., Barti, E., On the way to zero defect of plastic-encapsulated electronic power devices-Part II: molding compound (2009) Device Mater Reliab, 9, pp. 279-287; Alpern, P., Nelle, P., Barti, E., On the way to zero defect of plastic-encapsulated electronic power devices-Part III: chip coating, passivation, and design (2009) Device Mater Reliab, 9, pp. 288-295; Gäbler, U., Österreicher, I., Bosk, P., Zero defect manufacturing as a challenge for advanced failure analysis (2007) In: Advanced semiconductor manufacturing conference, Stresa, Italy, , 11-12 June 2007; Raina, R., Achieving zero-defects for automotive applications (2008) IEEE international test conference, , Santa Clara, USA, 28-30 Oct. 2008; Linger, R.C., Cleanroom software engineering for zero-defect software (1993) In: The 15th international conference on software engineering, , Baltimore, USA, 17-21 May 1993; Mills, H.D., Dyer, M., Linger, R.C., Cleanroom software engineering (1987) IEEE Softw, 4 (5), pp. 19-25; Westkamper, E., Warnecke, H.J., Zero-defect manufacturing by means of a learning supervision of process chains (1994) Ann CIRP, 43 (1), pp. 406-408; Dakshinamoorthy, S., Zero defects quality and reliability challenges for growing markets (2008) In: Integrated reliability workshop final report, , South Lake Tahoe, USA, 12-16 Oct. 2008; Hu, W., Starr, A.G., Zhou, Z., A systematic approach to integrated fault diagnosis of flexible manufacturing systems (2000) Int J Mach Tools Manuf, 40, pp. 1560-1587; Kegg, R.L., On-line machine and process diagnostics (1984) Annals of the CIRP, 32 (2), pp. 469-573; Zhou, Z.D., Chen, Y.P., Fuh, J.H., Integrated condition monitoring and fault diagnosis for modern manufacturing system (2000) Ann CIRP, 49 (1), pp. 387-390; Piewak, S., A predictive monitoring and diagnosis system for manufacturing (1991) Ann CIRP, 40 (1), pp. 401-404; Monostori, L., A step towards intelligent manufacturing: modeling and monitoring of manufacturing processes with artificial neural network (1993) Ann CIRP, 42 (1), pp. 485-488; Shinno, H., Hashizume, H., In-process monitoring method for machining environment based on simultaneous multi-phenomena sensing (1997) Ann CIRP, 46 (1), pp. 53-56; Wang, K., (2003) Intelligent Condition Monitoring and Diagnosis Systems: A Computational Intelligence Approach, , Amsterdam: IOS Press; Wang, K., (2002) Intelligent Condition Monitoring and Diagnosis Systems, , Amsterdam: IOS Press; Lee, J., Ni, J., Djurdjanovic, D., Intelligent prognostics tools and e-maintenance (2006) Comput Ind, 57, pp. 476-489; Allocca, A., Stuart, A., (1984) Transducers: Theory and Applications.

However, most social networks remain impossible to be fully analyzed and understood due to prohibiting sizes and the incapability of traditional machine learning and data mining approaches to deal with the new dimension in the learning process related to the large-scale environment where the data are produced. On one hand, the birth and evolution of such networks has posed outstanding challenges for the learning and mining community, and on the other has opened the possibility for very powerful business applications. However, little understanding exists regarding these business applications and the potential of social network mining to boost marketing. This paper presents a review of the most important state-of-the-art approaches in the machine learning and data mining community regarding analysis of social networks and their business applications. The authors review the problems related to social networks and describe the recent developments in the area discussing important achievements in the analysis of social networks and outlining future work. The focus of the review in not only on the technical aspects of the learning and mining approaches applied to social networks but also on the business potentials of such methods.

Business process intelligence aims to apply data warehousing, data analysis and data mining techniques to process execution data, thus enabling the analysis, interpretation, and optimisation of business processes. Data mining approaches are especially effective in helping us to extract insights into customer behaviour, habits, potential needs and desires, credit associated risks, fraudulent transactions and etc. However, the integration of data mining into business processes still requires a lot of coordination and manual adjustment. This paper aims at reducing this effort by reusing successful data mining solutions. We propose an approach for implementation of data mining into a business process. The confirmation of the suggested approach is based on the results achieved in eight commercial companies, covering different industries, such as telecommunications, banking and retail. © 2013 Copyright Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press Technika.","business process; CRISP-DM; data mining; ontology; SOA",,,,,,,"Aguilar-Savén, R.S., Business process modelling: review and framework (2004) International Journal of Production Economics, 90 (2), pp. 129-149; Ankolekar, A., Burstein, M., Hobbs, J.R., Lassila, O., McDermott, D., Martin, D., McIlraith, S.A., Sycara, K., (2002) DAML-S: Web service description for the semantic web, 2342, pp. 348-363. , In:, In: Horrocks I., editorsHendler J., editors June, Sardinia; Arantes, E.A.Y.F.L., Meta-DM: an ontology for the data mining domain (2011) Revista de Sistemas de Informacao da FSMA, 8 (2011), pp. 36-45; Broadbent, M., Weill, P., St. Clair, D., The implications of information technology infrastructure for business process redesign (1999) MIS Quarterly, 23 (2), pp. 159-182; Chaffey, D., Wood, S., (2005) Business Information management: Improving performance using information systems, , Harlow, Harlow,: Prentice Hall; Cheung, W.K., Zhang, X.-F., Wong, H.-F., Liu, J., Luo, Z.-W., Tong, F.C.H., Service-oriented distributed data mining (2006) IEEE Internet Computing, 10 (4), pp. 44-54; Chung, H.M., Gray, P., Special Section: data mining (1999) Journal of Management Information Systems, 16 (1), pp. 11-16; Ciflikli, C., Ozjirmidokuz, E.K., Implementing a data mining solution for enhancing carpet manufacturing productivity (2010) Knowledge-Based Systems, 23 (8), pp. 783-788; Davenport, T.H., Short, J.E., The new industrial engineering: information technology and business process redesign (1990) Sloan Management Review, 31 (4), pp. 11-27; Dayal, U., Hsu, M., Ladin, R., (2001) Business process coordination: State of the art, trends, and open issues, pp. 3-13. , Roma; Falbo, R.A., Menezes, C.S., Rocha, A.R.C., (1998) A systematic approach for building ontologies, 1484, pp. 349-360. , In: Coelho H., editors Lisbon; Feelders, A., Daniels, H., Holsheimer, M., Methodological and practical aspects of data mining (2000) Information & Management, 37 (5), pp. 271-281; Gong, X., Zhang, T., Zhao, F., Dong, L., Yu, H., On service discovery for online data mining trails (2009), pp. 478-482. , QingdaoGray, P., New thinking about the enterprise (2005) Information Systems Management, 11 (1), pp. 91-95; Gruber, T.R., Toward principles for the design of ontologies for knowledge sharing (1995) International Journal of Human and Computer Studies, 43 (4-5), pp. 907-928; Guarino, N., (1998) Formal ontology and information systems, pp. 3-15. , Trento; Guedes, D., Meira Jr., W., Ferreira, R., Anteater: a service-oriented architecture for high-performance data mining (2006) IEEE Internet Computing, 10 (4), pp. 36-43; Kalibatiene, D., Vasilecas, O., Application of the ontology axioms for the development of OCL constraints from PAL constraints (2012) Informatica, 23 (3), pp. 369-390; Kohavi, R., Provost, F., Applications of data mining to electronic commerce (2001) Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 5 (1-2), pp. 5-10; Kovačič, A., Bosilj-Vukšić, V., (2005) Business process management, , GV založba, (in Slovene); Kurgan, L.A., Musilek, P., A survey of knowledge discovery and data mining process models (2006) The Knowledge Engineering Review, 21 (1), pp. 1-24; Lavrač, N., Vavpetič, A., Soldatova, L., Trajkovski, I., Kralj, N.P., (2011) Using ontologies in semantic data mining with SEGS and g-SEGS, pp. 165-178. , In:, In:, In: Elomaa T., editorsHollmen J., editorsMannila H., editors October, Espoo; Li, L.S., Dang, Y.Z., Sun, J., Ping, J.Y., (2010) A multi-dimensional ontology model for product lifecycle knowledge management, pp. 1-4. , In: Wang H., editors Henan, IEEE; Moss, L.T., Atre, S., (2003) Business intelligence roadmap: The complete project lifecycle for decision-support applications, , Indiana, Indiana,: Addison-Wesley Professional; (2005) Ontology definition metamodel, , http://www.omg.org/spec/ODM/1.0/PDF/, OMG [online], [cited 8 March 2013].

This paper is an attempt to introduce application of data mining techniques in the manufacturing industry to which least importance has been given. A taste of implement-able areas in manufacturing enterprises is discussed with a proposed architecture, which can be applied to an individual enterprise as well as to an extended enterprise to get benefit of data mining technique and to share the discovered knowledge among enterprises. The paper proposes conceptual methods for better use of different data mining techniques in product manufacturing life cycle. These techniques include statistical techniques, neural networks, decision trees and genetic algorithms. An integrated and unified data mining platform is anticipated then to improve overall manufacturing process.","Data Mining; Data Mining methodologies; Data Warehousing; Industrial application; Manufacturing",,,,,,,"Netz, A., Integration of Data Mining and Relational Databases Proceedings of the 26thInternational Conference on Very Large Databases, , Cairo, Egypt; Harding, J.A., Yu, B., Information-centred enterprise design supported by a factory data model and data warehousing (1999) Computers in Industry, 40, pp. 23-36. , Elsevier; Harding, J.A., Yu, B., Popplewell, J., Information modelling: An integration of views of a manufacturing enterprise (1999) International Journal of Production Research, 37 (12), pp. 2777-2792; Hazelrigg, G.A., (1996) Systems Engineering: An approach to Information-Based Design, , Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice-Hall, Inc; Pahl, G., Beitz, W., (1999) Engineering Design, , London: Springer-Verlag; Dym, C.L., Levitt, R.E., Knowledge-Based Systems in Engineering; Carol, J.R., Rakesh, N., A data Mining-Bases Engineering Design Support System: A Research Agenda (1991) Data Mining for Design and Manufacturing: Methods and Applications Ed.

Within these mountains of data are seams of gold-patterns of behavior that can be interpreted, classified and analyzed to allow predictions of real value. Which treat-ment is likely to be most effective for this patient? What can we offer that this particular customer is more likely to buy? Can we identify if that transaction is fraudulent before the sale is closed? To these questions and more, operational analytics-the combination of deep data analysis and transaction processing systems-has an answer. This paper describes what operational analytics is and what it offers to the business. We explore its relationship to business intelligence (BI) and see how traditional data warehouse architectures struggle to support it. Now, the combination of advanced hardware and software technologies provide the opportunity to create a new integrated platform delivering powerful operational analytics within the existing IT fabric of the enterprise. With the IBM DBAnalytics Accelerator, a new hardware/software offer-ing on System z, the power of the massively parallel processing (MPP) IBM Netezza is closely integrated with the mainframe and accessed directly and transparently via DBon z/OS. The IBM DB2 Analytics Accelerator brings enormous query performance gains to analytic queries and enables direct integration with operational processes. This integrated environment also enables distributed data marts to be re-turned to the mainframe environment, enabling significant reductions in data management and total ownership costs. © 2012, 9sight Consulting, all rights reserved.",,"Data warehouse architecture; Hardware and software; Integrated environment; Integrated platform; Massively parallel processing; Operational analytics; Operational process; Transaction processing; Data warehouses; Hardware; Information management; Sales",,,,,,"IBM institute of business value (2011) Customer Analytics Pay off, , GBE03425-USEN-00; Business Analytics Will Enable Tailored Flight Pricing, Says American Airlines, , http://bit.ly/znTJrc, Computer Weekly, 28 October 2010, accessed 14 February 2012; Marlowe, C., (1592) Doctor Faustus, , act 1, scene 1; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics, accessed 24 January 2012Davenport, T.H., Harris, J.G., (2007) Competing on Analytics: The New Science of Winning, , Harvard Business School Press; Taylor, J., (2011) Where to Begin with Predictive Analytics, , http://bit.ly/yr333L, 1 September, accessed 8 February 2012; Selden, L., Colvin, G., (2004) Killer Customers : Tell the Good from the Bad and Crush Your Competitors, , Portfolio; Devlin, B.A., Murphy, P.T., (1988) An Architecture for A Business and Information System, 27 (1), p. 60. , http://bit.ly/EBIS1988, IBM Systems Journal; Devlin, B., (1997) Data Warehouse-From Architecture to Implementation, , Addison-Wesley; Inmon, W.H., Imhoff, C., Battas, G., (1996) Building the Operational Data Store, , http://bit.ly/ODS1995, John Wiley & Sons; Rubin, H.R., (2010) Economics of Computing-The Internal Combustion Mainframe, , http://bit.ly/zQ1y8D, accessed 16 March 2012; Rubin, H.R., (2010) Technology Economics: The Cost Effectiveness of Mainframe Computing, , http://bit.ly/wsBHRb, accessed 16 March 2012; (2008) Knowing Beats Guessing, , http://bit.ly/AvlAao, Gary Loveman Chairman Of The Board President And CEO Harrah's Quoted In Accenture Presentation, June accessed 5 March 2012","Devlin, B.; 9sight Consulting, BeyeNETWORK, TDWI, Cape Town, South Africa; email: barry@9sight.com",,,,,,,,,,,,"English","IBM Data Manag.

An evolutionary, process-oriented theoretical framework describes how dynamic and organisational capabilities interact over time to create value. The framework is then used to explain how business analytics systems provided value and competitive advantage in a longitudinal case study of a large financial institution.

The focus is on the analysis of the security risks and performance of the organisation's Security Incident Management Processes and related Security Operation Centre (SOC)'s activities. HP Labs carried out the underlying R&D work in collaboration with HP Enterprise Security Services (HP ESS) and involved analysis of processes, probabilistic modeling, simulation and ""what-if"" analysis for some of HP's key customers. The outcome of this was a set of case studies from which we have been able to create this more general anonymised report illustrating the richness of the risk assessment and ""what-if"" analysis that has been carried out. The lifecycle management of security is critical for organisations to protect their key assets, ensure a correct security posture and deal with emerging risks and threats. It involves various steps, usually carried out on an ongoing, regular basis, including: risk assessment; policy definition; deployment of controls within the IT infrastructure; monitoring and governance. In this context, Security Information & Events Management (SIEM) solutions play a key role. Even the best information security practices and investments in security controls cannot guarantee that intrusions - accidental and criminal activities - and/or other malicious acts will not happen. Controls can fail, be bypassed or become inadequate over time; new threats emerge. Managing such incidents requires detective and corrective controls to minimise adverse impacts, gather evidence, and learn from previous situations in order to improve over time. These incident management processes are usually run in the context of a SOC and/or as part of specialised Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTS), built on top of SOCs. Even with SIEM solutions in place, a potential major risk for the organisation arises due to delays introduced in assessing and handling known incidents: this may postpone the successful resolution of critical security incidents (e.g. devices exposed on the Internet, exploitation of privileged accounts, deployed malware, etc.) and allow for further exploitation. Another related risk can be introduced by sudden and/or progressive changes of the threat landscape, due to changing economic and social scenarios, new business activities or process failings within the existing IT services. This might create unexpected volumes of new events and alerts to be processed by the security team and as such, introduce additional delays. Hence, it is important for an organisation to understand the risk exposure due to their Incident Management processes, explore potential future scenarios (e.g. changes in available resources or threats landscapes or adoption of Cloud solutions) and identify suitable ways to address related issues, e.g. by introducing process changes and/or making investments in security controls. © Copyright 2012 Hewlett-Packard Development Company, L.P.","Incident Management Processes; Risk Analysis; Security Analytics; SOC; What-if Analysis","Business activities; Corrective control; Criminal activities; Enterprise security; Hp labs; Incident Management; Information security practice; IT infrastructures; IT services; Life-cycle management; Malwares; Probabilistic modeling; Process change; Related risk; Risk exposure; Security Analytics; Security controls; Security incident; Security operations; Security risks; SOC; Social scenarios; What-if Analysis; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk management; Security of data; Security systems; Investments",,,,,,"(2011) Incident Amd Incident Management, , http://www.itil-officialsite.com/, ITIL; (2011) Build Security In, Incident Management, , https://buildsecurityin.uscert.gov/bsi/articles/best-practices/incident. html, Homeland Security; (2011) SIEM Solution, , http://www.arcsight.com/, HP ArcSight; (2011) SIEM Solution, , http://www.rsa.com/node.aspx?id=3170, RSA enVision; Bidou, R., Concepts & Implementation, , http://www.iv2-technologies.com/SOCConceptAndImplementation.pdf, Security Operation Center (SOC); (2008) Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT), , http://www.cert.org/csirts/csirt_faq.html, CERT; (2011) MetricStream, Collaborative Incident Analysis and Remediaiton Solutions, , http://www.metricstream.com/solutions/it_incident_management.htm; (2011) Incident Response Plan & Management, , http://www.wolfpacsolutions.com/solutions/incident_response_plan, WolfPack; Change Management, , http://www.bmc.com/products/offering/itil-changeconfiguration-release- management-software.html, BMC Remedy; (2011), http://h20195.www2.hp.com/V2/GetPDF.aspx/4AA3-2046EEW.pdf, HP Security Analytics","Mont, M.C.; Cloud and Security Lab, HP Labs, Bristol, United Kingdom; email: marco.casassa-mont@hp.com",,,,,,,,,,HLTRE,,"English","HP Lab Tech Rep",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866411297

Data mining and fuzzy clustering algorithms can serve for this purpose. This paper models the decision making process of a ceramics production company using a fuzzy clustering algorithm and data mining. Factors that affect the quality of slurry are measured over time. Using this data, a fuzzy clustering algorithm assigns the degrees of memberships of the slurry for the different quality clusters. An expert can decide on acceptance or rejection of slurry based on calculated degrees of memberships. In addition, by using data mining techniques we generated some rules that provide the optimum conditions for acceptance of the slurry.","Ceramics; Data mining; Decision trees; Fuzzy cluster analysis",,,,,,,"Arenas, M., Bilboa, A., Rodriguez Uria, M.V., Jimenez, M., A Fuzzy goal programming model for evaluating a hospital service performance (2001) Fuzzy Sets in Management, Economics, and Marketing, pp. 19-33. , World Scientific; Brouwer, R.K., Groenwold, A., Modified fuzzy c-means for ordinal valued attributes with particle swarm for optimization (2010) Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 161, pp. 1774-1789; Chen, T., Incorporating fuzzy c-means and a back-propagation network ensemble to job completion time prediction in a semiconductor fabrication factory (2007) Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 158, pp. 2153-2168; Chen, W.-C., Tseng, S.-S., Wang, C.-Y., Novel manufacturing defect detection method using association rule mining techniques (2005) Expert Systems with Applications, 29, pp. 807-815; Dabbas, R.M., Chen, H.-N., Mining semiconductor manufacturing data for productivity improvement-An integrated relational database approach (2001) Computers in Industry, 45, pp. 29-44; Dunham, M.H., (2002) Data Mining: Introductory and Advanced Topics, , Prentice Hall PTR; Emami, M.R., Türksen, B.I., Goldenberg, A.A., An improved fuzzy modeling algorithm part I: Inference mechanism (1996) Proceedings of Fuzzy Information Processing Society, , NAFIPS, Biennial Conference of the North American; Emami, M.R., Türksen, B.I., Goldenberg, A.A., Development of a systematic methodology of fuzzy logic modeling (1998) IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 6, pp. 346-361; Freitas, A., (2002) Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery with Evolutionary Algorithms, , Springer-Verlag; Garcia-Lapresta, J.L., Martinez-Panero, M., Lazzari, L.L., A group decision making method using fuzzy triangular numbers (2001) Fuzzy Sets in Management, Economics, and Marketing, pp. 35-50. , World Scientific; Göleç, A., (2001) Fuzzy Modelling Approach in Feature-Based Computer-Aided Process Planning, , Ph.D thesis, Sakarya University in Kayseri; Hand, D., Manila, H., Smyth, P., (2001) Principles of Data Mining, , A Bradford Book, The MIT Press; Houtsma, M., Swami, A., Set-oriented data mining in relational databases (1995) Data & Knowledge Engineering, 17, pp. 245-262; Josien, K., Liao, T.W., Integrated use of fuzzy C-means and fuzzy KNN for GT part family and machine cell formation (2000) International Journal of Production Research, 38, pp. 3513-3536; Jiawei, H., Kamber, M., (2001) Data Mining: Concepts And Techniques, , University Of Simon Fraser; Kusiak, A., Smith, M., Data mining in design of products and production systems (2007) Annual Reviews in Control, 31, pp. 147-156; Kumar, S., Rao, C.S.P., Application of ant colony, genetic algorithm and data mining-based techniques for scheduling (2009) Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing, 25, pp. 901-908; Li, D.-C., Yeh, C.-W., A non-parametric learning algorithm for small manufacturing data sets (2008) Expert Systems with Applications, 34, pp. 391-398; Magkos, E., Maragoudakis, M., Chrissikopoulos, V., Gritzalis, S., Accurate and large-scale privacy-preserving data mining using the election paradigm (2009) Data & Knowledge Engineering, 68, pp. 1224-1236; Nong, Y., (2003) The Handbook of Data Mining, , Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Publishers; Öztürk, A., Kayaligil, S., Nur, E., Özdemirel, Manufacturing lead time estimation using data mining (2006) European Journal of Operational Research, 173, pp. 683-700; Pal, N.R., Bezdek, J.C., On cluster validity for the fuzzy c-means model (1995) IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 3, pp. 370-379; Sangjae, L., Using data envelopment analysis and decision trees for efficiency analysis and recommendation of B2C controls (2010) Decision Support Systems, 49, pp. 486-497; Setnes, M., Supervised fuzzy clustering for rule extraction (2000) IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 8, pp. 416-424; Sugeno, M., Yasukawa, T., A fuzzy-logic based approach to qualitative modeling (1993) IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 1, pp. 7-31; (2005) "" User Manual of Polyanalyst 5,""; Yan, W., Chen, C.-H., Shieh, M.-D., Product concept generation and selection using sorting technique and fuzzy c-means algorithm (2006) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 50, pp. 273-285; Witten, I.H., Frank, E., (2005) Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques, , Elsevier","Gürbüz, F.; Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Erciyes, Kayseri 38039, Turkey; email: feyza@erciyes.edu.tr",,,,,,,,15475816,,,,"English","J.

The real value comes from information and services derived from data correlation, tailored to specific interest. We claim that the availability of a Living Open Data Framework enables the exploitation of data through services, created by many parties, in several contexts. However, data correlation is fraught with perils, from the obvious of privacy breaching to more subtle ownership and value protection. These issues are of fundamental importance and have to be addressed to create a viable business based on data and require advances in technology and in the regulatory framework.

A large part of corporate information, approximately 80%, is available in textual data formats. Text Classification techniques are well known for managing on-line sources of digital documents. The identification of key issues discussed within textual data and their classification into two different classes could help decision makers or knowledge workers to manage their future activities better. This research is relevant for most text based documents and is demonstrated on Post Project Reviews (PPRs) which are valuable source of information and knowledge. The application of textual data mining techniques for discovering useful knowledge and classifying textual data into different classes is a relatively new area of research. The research work presented in this paper is focused on the use of hybrid applications of text mining or textual data mining techniques to classify textual data into two different classes. The research applies clustering techniques at the first stage and Apriori Association Rule Mining at the second stage. The Apriori Association Rule of Mining is applied to generate Multiple Key Term Phrasal Knowledge Sequences (MKTPKS) which are later used for classification. Additionally, studies were made to improve the classification accuracies of the classifiers i.e. C4.5, K-NN, Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The classification accuracies were measured and the results compared with those of a single term based classification model. The methodology proposed could be used to analyse any free formatted textual data and in the current research it has been demonstrated on an industrial dataset consisting of Post Project Reviews (PPRs) collected from the construction industry. The data or information available in these reviews is codified in multiple different formats but in the current research scenario only free formatted text documents are examined. Experiments showed that the performance of classifiers improved through adopting the proposed methodology. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

These scripts, named moleculaRnetworks, are intended for the geometric and solvent network analysis of aqueous solutes and can be extended to other H-bonded solvents. New algorithms, several of which are based on graph theory, that interrogate the solvent environment about a solute are presented and described. This includes a novel method for identifying the geometric shape adopted by the solvent in the immediate vicinity of the solute and an exploratory approach for describing H-bonding, both based on the PageRank algorithm of Google search fame. The moleculaRnetworks codes include a preprocessor, which distills simulation trajectories into physicochemical data arrays, and an interactive analysis script that enables statistical, trend, and correlation analysis, and other data mining. The goal of these scripts is to increase access to the wealth of structural and dynamical information that can be obtained from molecular simulations.

The websites providing these e-services collect large amounts of users' activity and evaluation data. It is necessary to transform these data into useful business analytics that allow a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the e-service, the various types of value it generates, and its whole value generation mechanism, and at the same time provide guidance for its improvement and optimization. We propose and validate a methodology for transforming user evaluation data into useful business analytics, founded on the technology acceptance model, the IS success model and e-services. We define a three-layer value model for e-services, including concerning its efficiency, effectiveness and impact on users' future behavior respectively. This value model is used for collecting and processing service evaluation data from users. We calculated two classes of business analytics: average users' ratings to identify strengths and weaknesses of e-services; and the impacts of first- layer value measures on the second and third layer value ones.

Data mining techniques have been used for process optimization in many manufacturing processes in automotive, LCD, semiconductor, and steel production, among others. However, a large amount of missing values occurs in the data set due to several causes (e.g.; data discarded by gross measurement errors, measurement machine breakdown, routine maintenance, sampling inspection, and sensor failure), which frequently complicate the application of data mining to the data set. This study proposes a new procedure for optimizing processes called missing values-Patient Rule Induction Method (m-PRIM), which handles the missing-values problem systematically and yields considerable process improvement, even if a significant portion of the data set has missing values. A case study in a semiconductor manufacturing process is conducted to illustrate the proposed procedure. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This is because conventional approaches fail to extract hidden relationships between numerous complex process control parameters. In order to highlight correlations between such parameters, we propose in this paper a complete knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) model. The mining heart of the model uses a new method derived from association rules programming, and is based on two concepts: decision correlation rules and contingency vectors. The first concept results from a cross fertilization between correlation and decision rules. It enables relevant links to be highlighted between sets of values of a relation and the values of sets of targets belonging to the same relation. Decision correlation rules are built on the twofold basis of the chi-squared measure and of the support of the extracted values. Due to the very nature of the problem, levelwise algorithms only allow extraction of results with long execution times and huge memory occupation. To offset these two problems, we propose an algorithm based both on the lectic order and contingency vectors, an alternate representation of contingency tables. This algorithm is the basis of our KDD model software, called MineCor. An overall presentation of its other functions, of some significant experimental results, and of associated performances are provided and discussed. © 2011 IEEE.","Chi 2 correlation statistic; data mining; decision rule; semiconductor anufacturing","Chi-Squared; Complex Processes; Contingency table; Control parameters; Conventional approach; Correlated parameters; Correlation rule; Correlation statistics; Cross fertilization; Data-mining tools; Decision rules; Enhancement techniques; Execution time; Knowledge discovery in database; Levelwise algorithms; Semiconductor manufacturing industry; Semiconductor manufacturing process; Algorithms; Semiconductor device manufacture; Data mining",,,,,,"Han, J., Kamber, M., (2000) Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques, , Waltham, MA: Morgan Kaufmann; Piatetsky-Shapiro, G., Matheus, C.J., The interingness of deviations (1994) Proc.

Methods According to CRISP 1.0 methodology, a data mining (DM) project was developed on a data warehouse containing records for 501 patients operated on for lung cancer with curative intention. The modelling technique was logistic regression. Results The fi nally selected model presented the following values: sensitivity 9.68%, specifi city 100%, global precision 94.02%, positive predictive value 100% and negative predictive value 93.98% for a cut-off point set at 0.5. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed. The area under the curve (CI 95%) was 0.817 (0.740- 0.893) (p<0.05). Statistical association with perioperative mortality was found for the following variables [odds ratio (CI 95%)]: age over 70 [2.3822 (1.0338-5.4891)], heart disease [2.4875 (1.0089-6.1334)], peripheral arterial disease [5.7705 (1.9296-17.2570)], pneumonectomy [3.6199 (1.4939-8.7715)] and length of surgery (min) [1.0067 (1.0008-1.0126)]. Conclusions The CRISP-DM process model is very suitable for lung cancer surgery analysis, improving decision making as well as knowledge and quality management.","CRISP-DM; Data mining; Knowledge discovery in databases; Lung cancer; Surgery mortality","adult; aged; article; cancer surgery; controlled study; female; health care quality; human; lung cancer; lung resection; major clinical study; male; medical decision making; methodology; mining; mortality; peripheral occlusive artery disease; predictive value; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; surgical mortality; total quality management; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Data Mining; Decision Making; Female; Humans; Knowledge; Logistic Models; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Theoretical; Predictive Value of Tests; Pulmonary Surgical Procedures; Quality of Health Care; Risk Factors; ROC Curve",,,,,,"Turban, E., Aronson, J.E., (2001) Decision Support Systems and Intelligent Systems, , Prentice Hall International, New Jersey; Hernández, J., Ramírez, M.J., Ferri, C., (2004) Introducción A la Minería de Datos, , Pearson Education, Madrid; Hosmer, D.W., Lemeshow, S., (1989) Applied Logistic Regression, , Wiley, New York; Guidelines on the selection of patients with lung cancer for surgery (2001) Thorax, 56, pp. 89-108. , British Thoracic Society and Society of Cardio-thoracic Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland Working Party; Katz, M.H., Multivariable analysis (2006) A Practical Guide for Clinicians, , 2nd edn.

Our approach to cultural context is primarily driven by Hall's (1976) theory of high vs. low context dimensions and Hofstede's (1980, 2001, 2005) five-dimensional framework for analysing culture. Our four-stage conceptual model of decision-making draws on Zakaria (2006), Kingdon (1995), Adler (2002), and Güss (2002). We further explore this model of culture and decision-making with data from a four-year public e-mail archive (2002-2005) of the GVT of transnational civil society involved in UN World Summit on Information Society (WSIS). From a methodological perspective, we find that for our explicit cultural variables (gender and region), keyword content analysis and data mining techniques are powerful tools to unlock massive datasets. In contrast, for our implicit cultural variables (high-context and low-context communication styles and cultural values), these techniques were not yet as helpful. © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Cultural values; Data mining; Decision making process; Global virtual teams; Keyword analysis; QDA miner; Transnational civil society",,,,,,,"Adler, N.J., (2002) International Dimensions of Organizational Behavior, , 4th ed., South Western, Cincinnati, OH; Ailon, G., Mirror, mirror on the wall: Cultures' consequences in a value test of its own design (2008) Academy of Management Review, 33 (4), pp. 885-904; Berman, F., Brady, H., (2005) Final Report: NSF SBE-CISE Workshop on Cyberinfrastructure and the Social Sciences, , http://www.sdsc.edu/sbe, available at; Cogburn, D.L., Diversity matters, even at a distance: Evaluating the impact of computer mediated communication on civil society participation in the world summit on information society (2005) Information Technology and International Development, 1 (4), pp. 15-40; Gudykunst, W.B., Ting-Toomey, S., Chua, E.G., (1988) Intercultural Communication Theory: Inter personal Communication, , Sage, Beverly Hills, CA; Güss, C.D., Decision making in individualistic and collectivistic cultures (2002) Online Readings in Psychology and Culture, Unit 4, Chapter 3, Center for Cross-Cultural Research, , http://www.wwu.edu/~culture, in Lonner, W.J., Dinnel, D.L., Hayes, S.A. and Sattler, D.N.

When student voice is not included in reform efforts, these efforts are more likely to flounder. The emerging educational reform of data-driven decision making (DDDM) offers promise for increasing student achievement. However, scant research documents the involvement of students in DDDM reforms. Using a theoretical framework that advocates for democratically involving students in education reform, this cross-case analysis examines the role of students in DDDM reforms in elementary and high schools known to be exemplars of data-driven decision making. Based on findings of efforts made by exemplar districts as well as actions they did not take to involve students, the authors conclude that a new typology is necessary for assessing student involvement in DDDM. Consequently, the authors propose a new three-tiered typology for conceptualizing this phenomenon. © 2011 SAGE Publications.","data-driven decision making; education reform; student involvement; student voice; youth development",,,,,,,"Cammarota, J., Fine, M., (2008) Revolutionizing Education: Youth Participatory Action Research in Motion, , Cammarota J.Fine M., ed., New York: Routledge; Campbell, P., Students as evaluators: A model for program evaluation (1994) Phi Delta Kappan, 76, pp. 160-165; Colby, S., Smith, K., Shelton, J., (2005) Expanding the Supply of High Quality Public Schools, , San Francisco: Bridgespan; Cook-Sather, A., Authorizing students' perspectives: Toward trust, dialogue, and change in education (2002) Educational Researcher, 31 (4), pp. 3-14; Corbett, H.D., Rossman, G.B., Three paths to implementing change: A research note (1989) Curriculum Inquiry, 19, pp. 163-190; Datnow, A., Park, V., Kennedy, B., (2008) Acting on Data: How Urban High Schools Use Data to Improve Instruction, , Los Angeles: Center on Educational Governance, University of Southern California; Datnow, A., Park, V., Wohlstetter, P., (2007) Achieving with Data: How High-Performing School Systems Use Data to Improve Instruction for Elementary Students, , Los Angeles: Center on Educational Governance, University of Southern California; Eccles, J.S., Midgley, C., Wigfield, A., Buchanan, C.M., Reuman, D., Flanagan, C., Development during adolescence: The impact of stage-environment fit on young adolescents' experiences in schools and in families (1993) American Psychologist, 48 (2), pp. 90-101; Fielding, M., Students as radical agents of change (2001) Journal of Educational Change, 2, pp. 123-141; Fielding, M., Transformative approaches to student voice: Theoretical underpinnings, recalcitrant realities (2004) British Educational Research Journal, 30, pp. 295-311; Goodenow, C., Classroom belonging among early adolescent students: Relationship to motivation and achievement (1993) Journal of Early Adolescence, 13 (1), pp. 21-43; Hamilton, L., Halverson, R., Jackson, S., Mandinach, E., Supovitz, J., Wayman, J., (2009) Using student achievement data to support instructional decision making (NCEE 2009-4067), , http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/publications/practiceguides, Washington, DC: National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance, Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education.

As such knowledge (with its explicit and tacit constituents) is assumed to be one of the main variables whilst a distinguishing factor of such organizations; amidst those specialist in nature, to survive within a marketplace. Their main asset is the knowledge of certain highly imaginative individuals that appear to share a common vision for the continuity of the organization. Satellites and their related services remain a good example of that. From early pioneers to modern day satellite manufacturing firms, one can see a large amount of risk at every stage in the development of a satellite or a related service, from inception to design phase, from design to delivery, from lessons learnt from failures to those learnt from successes, and from revisions to design and development of successful missions. In their groundbreaking book The Knowledge Creating Company (1995), Nonaka et al laid out a model of how organizational knowledge is created through four conversion processes, being from: tacit to explicit (externalization), explicit to tacit (internalization), tacit to tacit (socialization), and explicit to explicit (combination). Key to this model is the authors' assertion that none are individually sufficient. All must be present to fuel one another. However, such knowledge creation and diffusion was thought to have manifested and only applied within large organizations and conglomerates. Observational and systematic (corpus-based) studies-through analysis of specialist text, can support research in knowledge management. Since text could be assumed to portray a trace of knowledge. In this paper we are to show how knowledge diffuses in a specific environment, and thus could be modeled by specialist text. That is dealing with the satellite manufacturing domain, and having embedded within the knowledge about the business sector and knowledge domain. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.","Corpus-based analysis; Knowledge diffusion; Knowledge management; Observa-tional study; Satellite manufacturing; Small medium enterprise; Text analysis","Corpus-based; Knowledge diffusion; Observa-tional study; Satellite manufacturing; Small medium enterprise; Text analysis; Design; Diffusion; Industry; Information technology; Societies and institutions; Knowledge management",,,,,,"Atkins, S., Clear, J., Ostler, N., Corpus Design Criteria (1992) Literary and Linguistic Computing, 7 (1), pp. 1-16; Bauere, L., (2001) Morphological Productivity, , (Cambridge studies in linguistics; 95).

In this paper we take the phases of the business cycle into consideration and use data mining as a technique to predict firms that may face a potential financial crisis. Since we hypothesize that financial crises are closely related to the business cycle, we have determined which periods show expansionary or recessionary trends. The objective of this paper is to determine important variables affecting financial crises and use this information to improve the accuracy of financial predictions. The electronic industry has been selected as the main focus, as this is a very important industry in Taiwan. Five experimental models have been designed for empirical study and an optimal model has also been established. From the results, we have discovered some important financial variables that can cause business's financial crises in different phases of the business cycle. In considering the business cycle, the model achieved better predictive accuracy and a support vector model has a higher predictive accuracy than other data mining techniques.","Business cycle; Data mining; Financial crisis; Financial engineering",,,,,,,"Altman, E., Financial ratios, discriminant analysis and the prediction of corporate bankruptcy (1968) The Journal of Finance, 23 (4), pp. 589-609; Beaver, W.H., Financial ratios as predictors of failures (1966) Journal of Accounting Research, 4, pp. 71-102; Chaveesuk, R., Srivaree-Ratana, C., Smith, A., Alternative Neural Network Approach to Corporate Bond Rating (1997) Journal of Engineering Valuation and Cost Analysis, 2 (2), pp. 117-131; Coats, P.K., Fant, L.F., Recognizing financial distress patterns using a neural network tool (1993) Financial Management, 22 (3), pp. 142-155; Cristiamini, N., Shawe-Taylor, J., (2000) An Introduction to Support Vector Machines, , Cambridge university press, Cambridge, England; Deakin, E.B., A discriminant analysis of predictors of business failure (1972) Journal of Accounting Research, 10 (1), pp. 167-179; Gehrke, J., Ramakrishnan, R., Loh, W.Y., BOAT-optimistic decision tree construction (1999) proceedings of International Conference Management of Data, Philadelphia, pp. 169-180; Guyon, I., Weston, J., Barnhill, S., Vapnik, V., Gene selection for cancer classification using support vector machines (2002) Machine Learning, 46 (1-3), pp. 389-422; Huang, Z., Chen, H., Hsu, J., Chen, W.H., Wu, S., Credit rating analysis with support vector machines and neural networks: a market comparative study (2004) Decision Support Systems, 37 (4), pp. 543-558; Hung, C., Chen, J., A selective ensemble based on expected probabilities for bankruptcy prediction (2009) Expert Systems with Applications, 36 (3), pp. 5297-5303; Kaiser, H.F., The application of electronic computers to factor analysis (1960) Educational and Psychological Measurement, 20 (1), pp. 141-151; Kirkos, E., Spathis, C., Manolopoulos, Y., Data Mining Techniques for the Detection of Fraudulent Financial Statements (2007) Expert Systems with Applications, 32 (4), pp. 995-1003; Merkevičius, E., Garšva, G., Girdzijauskas, S., (2006) A Hybrid SOM-Altman Model for Bankruptcy Prediction, pp. 364-371. , Lecture Notes in Computer Science 3994, Berlin/Heidelberg: Springer; Min, J.H., Lee, Y.C., Bankruptcy prediction using support vector machine with optimal choice of kernel function parameters (2005) Expert Systems with Applications, 28 (4), pp. 603-614; Odom, M., Sharda, R., A neural network model for bankruptcy prediction (1990) Proceedings of 1990 IJCNN international joint conference, San Diego, CA, USA, pp. 163-168; Ohlson, J., Financial ratios and the probabilistic prediction of bankruptcy (1980) Journal of Accounting Research, 18 (1), pp. 109-131; Olson, D.L., Yang, S., (2005) Introduction to Business Data Mining, , Boston, Mass., McGraw-Hill; Orgler, Y.E., A Credit Scoring Model for Commercial Loans (1970) Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking, 12 (4), pp. 435-445; Tsai, C., Feature selection in bankruptcy prediction (2009) European Journal of Operational Research, 22 (2), pp. 120-127; Varetto, F., Genetic algorithms applications in the analysis of insolvency risk (1998) Journal of Banking & Finance, 22 (10-11), pp. 1421-1439; Werbos, P.J., (1974) Beyond Regression: New Tools for Prediction and Analysis in the Behavioral Science, , Ph.D. Thesis, Harvard University, Cambridge; (2010), http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka, Weka, Data Mining with Open Source Machine Learning Software in Java,, access available: August 1, 2010","Ting, I.-H.; Department of Information Management, National University of KaohsiungTaiwan; email: iting@nuk.edu.tw",,,,,,,,10293132,,,,"English","Asia Pac.

Traditional statistical based techniques such as univariate and multivariate analyses have long been employed as a tool for creating model to detect faults. Unfortunately, modern semiconductor industries have the ability to produce measurement data collected directly from sensors during the production process and such highly voluminous data are beyond the capability of traditional process control method to detect fault in a timely manner. We thus propose the techniques based on the data mining technology to automatically generate an accurate model to predict faults during the wafer fabrication process of the semiconductor industries. In such process control context, the measurement data contain over 500 signals or features. The feature selection technique is therefore a necessary tool to extract the most potential features. Besides the feature selection method, we also propose an over-sampling technique to handle the highly imbalance situation of fail versus pass test cases. Such imbalance cases refer to rare class prediction in the data mining context. The experimental results support our assumption that choosing the right features and over-sampling rare cases can considerably improve detection accuracy of fault products and processes.","Data mining; Fault detection model; Feature selection; Over-sampling technique; Rare class mining; Semiconductor manufacturing process",,,,,,,"Alhammady, H., Ramamohanarao, K., The application of emerging patterns for improving the quality of rare- class classification (2004) Proc.

One of the most important challenges for data mining is finding the right and quick relation between data. Apriori algorithm is the most popular technique for discovering the repetitious patterns. Nevertheless, when we are using this technique, a database should be scanned numerously to calculate many sets of chosen items. Parallel and distributed calculations are among the effective strategies to accelerate the data mining process. In this paper, parallel distributed Apriori algorithm has been introduced as a solution for the problem. In this method, only one scan from database is needed. The procedure considers one factor from a collection of items. Therefore, production of the equilibrial work volume among the processors and reduction of the idle processor time is mentioned. In order to show the work of the proposed technique, it is compared with some other parallel algorithms of data mining.

This study aims to reveal whether or not the application of business analytics in strategic planning contributes to better company performance, and to formulate recommendations on how to integrate business analytics in companies' performance management systems. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a survey conducted with 89 respondents from high-technology firms, a group comparison between firms with strong performance and those with weak performance reveals significant differences between the two groups' strategic planning processes and application of business analytics. Findings: The empirical survey's results show that better-performing companies are characterized by a more sophisticated analytical planning process. Lower-performing firms acknowledge this competitive advantage. Based on these findings, the authors develop recommendations on how to integrate business analytics in performance management contexts. Research limitations: The empirical study's results are limited to high-technology industries in the cultural setting of Germany. Practical implications: The empirical results emphasize the competitive advantage gained by applying business analytics. The recommendations concerning analytical performance management should help managers to sensibly integrate the analytical toolbox in performance management contexts. Originality/value: This paper combines insights on the best usage of business analytics from the perspective of strategic planning experts, with recommendations for the integration of business analytics into the performance management framework from an academic perspective. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business analytics; Corporate strategy; Germany; Performance management; Strategic planning",,,,,,,"Baars, H., Kemper, H., Management support with structured and unstructured data - an integrated business intelligence framework (2008) Information Systems Management, 25 (2), pp. 132-148; Bouquet, C., Morrison, A., Birkinshaw, J., International attention and multinational enterprise performance (2009) Journal of International Business Studies, 40 (1), pp. 108-131; Davenport, T., Harris, J.G., (2007) Competing on Analytics: The New Science of Winning, , Harvard Business School Press, Boston, MA; Davenport, T.H., Harris, J.G., Morison, R., (2010) Analytics at Work: Smarter Decisions, Better Results, , Harvard Business School Press, Boston, MA; Malmi, T., Granlund, M., In search of management accounting theory (2009) European Accounting Review, 18 (3), pp. 597-620; Mason, R.B., The external environment's effect on management and strategy (2007) Management Decision, 45 (1), pp. 10-28; Mouritsen, J., Measuring and intervening: How do we theorise intellectual capital management?

Thus, data mining becomes more and more an integral part of operating a business. However, the integration of data mining into business processes still requires a lot of coordination and manual adjustment. This paper aims at reducing this effort by reusing successful data mining solutions. We describe a novel approach to facilitating the integration based on process patterns for data mining and demonstrate that these patterns allow for easy reuse and can significantly speed up the process of integration. We empirically evaluate our approach in a case study of fraud detection in the healthcare domain.

Organisations need to find innovative ideas to deal with customers and understand them better. This requires that they should be able to uncover hidden and unknown information from customer database using analytical tools like data mining (DM). This application of DM in CRM is explored by analysing the opinion of the employees and executives of service sector in India. The application of DM in CRM is being found through the questionnaires which are being framed by the authors. These questionnaires helped us to frame and test certain hypothesis which will help us to find the real existing situations of service sector in Indian service sector. We hope that this would help to create a clear picture of the importance of DM in CRM of service sector. © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Analytical CRM; CRM; Customer relationship management; Data mining; DM; India; Information technology; Level of significance; LOS; Mobile customer relationship management; PCA; Principal component analysis",,,,,,,"Ahmed, S.R., Application of DM in retail businesses (2004) IEEE International Conference on Information Technology: Coding and Computing (ITCC'04), pp. 44-55; Al-Mudimigh, A.S., Saleem, F., Ullah, Z., Efficient implementation of DM improve customer's behavior (2009) International Conference on Computer System and Applications, AICCSA 2009, pp. 7-10. , Art.

It must support heterogeneous distributed incident data, allow decision makers (DMs) to detect anomalies and extract useful knowledge, assist DMs in evaluating the risks and selecting an appropriate alternative during an incident, and provide differentiated services to satisfy the requirements of different incident management phases. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an incident information management framework that consists of three major components. The first component is a high-level data integration module in which heterogeneous data sources are integrated and presented in a uniform format. The second component is a data mining module that uses data mining methods to identify useful patterns and presents a process to provide differentiated services for pre-incident and post-incident information management. The third component is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) module that utilizes MCDM methods to assess the current situation, find the satisfactory solutions, and take appropriate responses in a timely manner. To validate the proposed framework, this paper conducts a case study on agrometeorological disasters that occurred in China between 1997 and 2001. The case study demonstrates that the combination of data mining and MCDM methods can provide objective and comprehensive assessments of incident risks. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The paper also seeks to establish a KM and aCRM based framework using data mining (DM) techniques, which helps in the enterprise decision-making. The objective is to share how KM and aCRM can be integrated into this seamless analytics framework to sustain excellence in decision making using effective data mining techniques and to explore how working on such aCRM system can be effective for enabling organizations delivering complete solutions. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on focused and dedicated study of the literature present on the aCRM, KM and data mining techniques. The paper considered how to develop a strategy and operational framework that would build aCRM on the foundation of existing DM techniques and KM approach to meet the business challenges. Based on this research, a customized, integrated framework, to match the needs of business was designed. Findings: KM focuses on managing knowledge within the organization and aCRM focuses on gaining analytical information from the customer data. Both KM and aCRM help in the decision making process and understanding. This knowledge is difficult to uncover. Hence, this paper explains the importance of data mining tools and techniques to uncover knowledge by the integration between KM and aCRM. This paper presents an integrated KM and aCRM based framework using DM techniques. Research limitations/implications: All the firms may not be in favor of adopting KM while implementing aCRM. The KM requires a convalesce of organizational culture, technology innovations, effective work force in culminating knowledge dissemination in all business domains. Practical implications: The organizations implementing this knowledge enabled aCRM framework would be easily able to convert their business knowledge via the analytical CRM to solve many business issues, such as increase response rates from direct mail, telephone, e-mail, and internet delivered marketing campaigns, increased sales and increased services. With aCRM, firms can identify their most profitable customers and use this knowledge for promotional schemes for those customers as well as identify future customers with prediction on ROI. Originality/value: The need for the integration of KM and aCRM is clear. It is written for practitioners who are looking for approaches to improve business performance and maintain high profits for their business by incorporating knowledge-enabled aCRM in their setup. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business analysis; Customer relations; Data mining; Knowledge management",,,,,,,"Ahn, J.Y., Kim, S.K., Han, K.S., On the design concepts for CRM system (2003) Industrial Management and Data Systems, 103 (5), pp. 324-331; Berson, A., Smith, S., Thearling, K., (1999) Building DM Applications for CRM, , McGraw-Hill Professional, Maidenhead; Campbell, A., Creating customer KM technology in CRM (2003) Knowledge and Process Management, 10 (1), pp. 3-17; Campbell, H.M., The role of organizational KM strategies in the quest for BI (2006) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Engineering Management, pp. 231-236; Chen, M.S., Han, J., Yu, P.S., DM: An overview from a database perspective (1996) IEEE Transaction on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 8 (6); Chen, R.S., Wu, R.C., Chen, J.Y., DM application in CRM of credit card businesses (2005) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference; Cody, W., Kreulen, J., Krishna, V., Spangler, W., The integration of BI and KM (2002) IBM Systems Journal, 41 (4), pp. 697-713; Cook, C., Cook, M., (2000) The Convergence of KM and BI, , www.brint.com/members/online/20080108/intelligence/, (accessed 29 August), Auerbach Publications, New York, NY; Intranet, D.N.D., (2004), accessed 31 AugustDoyle, S., A sample roadmap for aCRM (2005) Journal of Database Marketing and Customer Strategy Management, 12 (4), pp. 362-377; Doyle, S., Using a business case to secure a gestation for aCRM project (2007) Journal of Database Marketing and Customer Strategy Management, 14 (3), pp. 258-262; Eppler, M., Seifried, P., Renack, A., Improving knowledge intensive process through an enterprise knowledge medium (1999) Proceedings of the ACM SIGCPR Conference on Computer Personnel Research, New Orleans, USA, pp. 222-230; Haimila, S., KM in practice: The helping hand of BI (2001) KMWorld, 10 (10); Hall, J., BI: The missing link in your CRM strategy (2004) DM Review, 14 (6), p. 36; Hameed, I., KM and BI: What is the difference?

The amount of data maintained by websites to keep track of the visitors is growing exponentially. Benefitting from such data is the target of the study described in this paper. We investigate and explore the process of analyzing log data of website visitor traffic in order to assist the owner of a website in understanding the behavior of the website visitors. We developed an integrated approach that involves statistical analysis, association rules mining, and social network construction and analysis. First, we analyze the statistical data on the types of visitors that come to the website, as well as the steps they take to reach and satisfy the goal of their visit. Second, we derive association rules in order to identify the correlations between the web pages. Third, we study the links between the web pages by constructing a social network based on the frequency of access to the web pages such that two web pages get linked in the social network if they are identified as frequently accessed together. The value added from the overall analysis of the website and its related data should be considered valuable for ecommerce and commercial website owners; the owners will get the information needed to display targeted advertisements or messages to their customers. Such an automated approach gives advantage to its users in the current competitive cyberspace. In the long run, this is expected to allow for the increase in sales and overall customer loyalty. © 2010, Springer-Verlag.","Association rules mining; Customer behavior; Ecommerce; Social communities; Social network analysis; Web mining",,,,,,,"Abiteboul, S., Preda, M., Cobena, G., Adaptive on-line page importance computation.

While experimental techniques and available data sources are rapidly evolving, useful information is dispersed across a variety of sources, and sources of the same information often do not use the same format or nomenclature. To harness these expanding resources, scientists need tools that bridge nomenclature differences and allow them to integrate, organize, and evaluate the quality of information without extensive computation.Results: Sidekick, a genomic data driven analysis and decision making framework, is a web-based tool that provides a user-friendly intuitive solution to the problem of information inaccessibility. Sidekick enables scientists without training in computation and data management to pursue answers to research questions like ""What are the mechanisms for disease X"" or ""Does the set of genes associated with disease X also influence other diseases."" Sidekick enables the process of combining heterogeneous data, finding and maintaining the most up-to-date data, evaluating data sources, quantifying confidence in results based on evidence, and managing the multi-step research tasks needed to answer these questions. We demonstrate Sidekick's effectiveness by showing how to accomplish a complex published analysis in a fraction of the original time with no computational effort using Sidekick.Conclusions: Sidekick is an easy-to-use web-based tool that organizes and facilitates complex genomic research, allowing scientists to explore genomic relationships and formulate hypotheses without computational effort. Possible analysis steps include gene list discovery, gene-pair list discovery, various enrichments for both types of lists, and convenient list manipulation. Further, Sidekick's ability to characterize pairs of genes offers new ways to approach genomic analysis that traditional single gene lists do not, particularly in areas such as interaction discovery. © 2010 Doderer et al;

This study, through the examination of longitudinal K-12 teacher assigned grading histories for entire cohorts of students from a school district (n=188), demonstrates a novel application of hierarchical cluster analysis and pattern visualization in which all data points collected on every student in a cohort can be patterned, visualized and interpreted to aid in data driven decision making by teachers and administrators. Additionally, as a proof-of-concept study, overall schooling outcomes, such as student dropout or taking a college entrance exam, are identified from the data patterns and compared to past methods of dropout identification as one example of the usefulness of the method.

Data are continually collected in the form of a history of tool usage, electrical and other real-valued measurements-a dimension of tens of thousands of features. Unique to this approach is the inference of patterns in the form of binary regression rules that demonstrate a significantly higher or lower performance value for tools relative to the overall mean for that manufacturing step. Results are filtered by knowledge-based constraints, increasing the likelihood that empirically validated rules will prove interesting and worth further investigation.

Using data mining technology to aid the data processing, information retrieval and knowledge generation process has become one of the critical missions to enterprise, so how to use data mining tools properly is user concern. Since not every user completely understand the theory of data mining, choosing the best solution from the functions which data mining tools provides is not easy. If user is not satisfied with the outcome of mining, communication with IT employees to adjust the software costs lots of time. To solve this problem, a selection model of data mining algorithms is proposed. By analyzing the content of business decision and application, user requirements will map to certain data mining category and algorithm. This method makes algorithm selection faster and reasonable to improve the efficiency of applying data mining tools to solve business problems. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

These companies retrieve more information with the same set of resources by means of business intelligence methods. According to Rubin (Chabrow, 2004) IT budgets are not simply declining or levelling off, rather, companies are shifting from a pure cost-cut mode to a model that emphasises agility and efficiency. Tremendous daily growth of the company data requires more funds and investment for establishing the technologies and infrastructure necessary for gathering fast and crucial information that supports the decision making process. This necessity gave birth to various business intelligence methods, which mainly aim to process mass amount of collected data from their existing application, and represent it in a way with which companies can apply to their daily competitive decisions. This application primarily concerns the implementation of business intelligence for a retail business company. The aim is to implement built-in business intelligence solutions of the Microsoft SQL Server that holds the commercial information of the company for the past three years. The customer company has already been using Microsoft products. The key items used for analyzing data are sales, momentary inventory and logistics information. The application can be grouped in five main areas: Building the data warehouse, constructing OLAP cubes, applying data mining algorithms on OLAP cubes, representing the results in reports with reporting services, and implementation. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Co.","business intelligence; data mining; OLAP; reporting services; Retail",,,,,,,"Chabrow, E., (2004) Tech Spending Is in Agility and Efficiency, , http://www.informationweek.com/news/globalcio/roi/showArticle.jhtml? articleID=53701039, Accessed 15/02/2010; Chitkara, A.R., (2010) BI 2010: Evolving to Meet Demands of the Changing Business Landscape, , http://tdwi.org/Articles/2010/01/06/BI-2010-Evolving-to-Meet-Demands-of- the-Changing-Business-Landscape.aspx?Page=3, Accessed 15/02/2010; Eckerson, W.W., (2010) TDWI Announces New Best Practices Report: Transforming Finance: How CFOs Use Business Intelligence to Turn Finance from Record Keepers to Strategic Advisors, , http://tdwi.org/Articles/2010/01/20/TDWI-Announces-New-Best-Practices- Report-Transforming-Finance-How-CFOs-Use-Business-Intelligence-to.aspx?Page=1, Accessed 15/2/2010; Granebring, A., Revay, P., (2007) Service-oriented Architecture Is A Driver for Daily Decision Support, , http://www.eki.mdh.se/personal/agg01/SOA%20is%20an%20OLAP%20driver.pdf, Accessed 30/06/2008; Hancock, J.C., Toren, R., (2006) Practical Business Intelligence with SQL Server 2005 (Microsoft Windows Server System Series), , http://www.businessobjects.com/company/customers/spotlight/tesco.asp, Addison Wesley Accessed 30/06/2008; (2008) Business Intelligence Case Studies, , http://www.winmetrics.com/olapcasestudies.html, WinMetrics Corporation Accessed 30/06/2008; Jacobson, R., Misner, S., Consulting, H., (2006) Microsoft R; SQL Server(TM) 2005 Analysis Services Step by Step (Step by Step (Microsoft)), , Redmond, WA: Microsoft Press; Kimball, R., Ross, M., (2002) The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Complete Guide to Dimensional Modeling (Second Edition), , Indianapolis: Wiley, Publishing, Inc; Langit, L., (2007) Foundations of SQL Server 2005 Business Intelligence, , New York: APress; MacLennan, J., (2004) Unearth the New Data Mining Features of Analysis Services 2005, , http://msdn.microsoft.com/tr-tr/magazine/cc300503(en-us).aspx, Accessed 30/6/2008; Zh, T., MacLennan, J., (2005) Data Mining with SQL Server 2005, , Indianapolis: Wiley Publishing, Inc; Thomsen, E., (2002) OLAP Solutions: Building Multidimensional Information Systems, , Indianapolis: John Wiley & Sons, Inc; Turley, P., Bryant, T., Counihan, J., Duvarney, D., (2006) Professional SQL Server 2005 Reporting Services, , Indianapolis: Wiley, Publishing, Inc; Wrembel, R., Koncilia, C., (2006) Data Warehouses and Olap: Concepts, Architectures and Solutions, , Hershey, PA: IRM Press","Dokuz Eylül University, Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences, Dokuzçeşmeler, Buca 35160, Izmir, Turkey",,,,,,,,02196492,,,,"English","J.

Many asset management organisations need to manage their data for a long period of time (e.g. Water supply pipelines data will be kept for more than 100 years in utility companies). Due to the inability to access original data requirements and system design documentation, it is difficult for these organisations to redesign their asset management systems which often results in ongoing data quality problems. Our nation-wide data quality survey of 2500 Australian engineering management organisations and a pilot study have revealed that many of the data quality problems emanate from inconsistent applications of business rules that govern the behaviour of data (e.g. data management, data flow, system interactions and so on) within asset management information systems. Thus, this research will investigate the problems of business rule-based data and information integration from disparate sources in various forms found in asset management systems (e.g. Databases, Excel spreadsheets, etc.). This research aims at developing innovative methods to automatically discover undocumented business rules from disparate data sources and to use business rules for automated data integration in order to deliver quality asset data sets. © Springer 2010.","Business Rule and Discovery; Data Quality",,,,,,,"Ballou, D., Wang, R., Pazer, H., Tayi, G.K., Modeling Information Manufacturing Systems to Determine Information Product Quality (1998) Management Science, 44 (4), pp. 462-484; Batini, C., Catarci, T., Scannapiceco, M., (2004) A survey of data quality issues in cooperative information systems, , Tutorial Presented at the 23rd International Conference on Conceptual Modeling (ER2004), Shanghai, China; Bouzeghoub, M., Peralta, V., A framework for analysis of data freshness (2004) Proceedings of the First ACM International Workshop on Information Quality in Information Systems (IQIS 2004), , Paris, France; (2001) What is a Business Rule, , http://www.businessrulesgroup.org/, Business Rules Group, URL, Online accessed [1/10/2007]; Choi, I., Cho, H., Bae, S., Hyun, S., Rule management for integration of information system (2000) International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing, 13 (5), pp. 446-460. , 1 September 2000; English, L.P., (1999) Improving Data Warehouse and Business Information Quality: Methods for reducing costs and increasing Profits, , Willey & Sons; Fox, C., Levitin, A.V., Redman, T.C., The notion of data and its quality dimensions (1994) Information Processing & Management, 30 (1), pp. 9-19; Gao, J., Koronios, A., Lin, S., (2006) Data Quality in Engineering Asset Management Organisations-Current Picture in Australia, , the international conference of Information Quality, November 2006, Boston, USA; Ives, B., Olson, M., Baroudi, J.J., The measurement of user information satisfaction (1983) Communications of the ACM, 26 (10), pp. 785-793; Kahn, B.K., Strong, D.M., Wang, R.Y., Information Quality Benchmarks: Product and Services Performance (2002) Communications of the ACM, 45 (4), pp. 184-192; Klein, B.D., Goodhue, D.L., Davis, G.B., Can humans detect errors in data?

Business ontologies within the semantic web are an excellent tool for managing knowledge within this space. The proposal in this article consists of a methodology for integrating information in companies. The application of this methodology results in the creation of a specific business ontology capable of semantic interoperability. The resulting ontology, developed from the information system of specific companies, represents the fundamental business concepts, thus making it a highly appropriate information integration tool. Its level of semantic expressivity improves on that of its own sources, and its solidity and consistency are guaranteed by means of checking by current reasoning tools. An ontology created in this way could drive the renewal processes of companies' information systems. A comparison is also made with a number of well-known business ontologies, and similarities and differences are drawn, highlighting the difficulty in aligning general ontologies to specific ones, such as the one we present. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Drawing on a mixed methods study of a statewide reading coach program in Florida middle schools, the article examines how coaches support DDDM and how this support relates to student and teacher outcomes. Authors find that although the majority of coaches spent time helping teachers analyze student data to guide instruction, data support was one among many coach activities. Estimates from models indicate that data analysis support, nevertheless, has a significant association with both perceived improvements in teaching and higher student achievement. © 2010 The Author(s).","Data-driven decision making; instructional coach",,,,,,,"Black, P., William, D., Assessment and classroom living.

The organisations need to interact more often with customers to understand their needs and preferences, which is possible only when the barriers of customer interactions are enhanced (e.g., accessing remotely located customer, etc.). The paper proposes the guiding principles for successful mobile CRM (mCRM) in organisation considering data mining (DM) tools and techniques. The gap between the combined use of proven technologies like wireless communication, DM tools and techniques in system like CRM is big which can be only narrowed through guiding principles. The approach to identify critical business principles for mCRM implementation is based on intensive information gathering process from officials and staff of customer-centric organisations like banking, retails, insurance and automobile which are very critical for successful implementation of mCRM in the organisation from DM perspective. © 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","CRM;

The case study company is a manufacturer of metal frames for actuators; one important part in hard the disk drive head. More than 300 computer numerical control (CNC) machines are used to fabricate the contour of the metal frames. During production, random sample are taken from the process so as to be inspected within the quality control (QC) department. If samples show a tendency to be out of specification, the machines that produced them have to be adjusted or even shutdown. Large amounts of data are produced during this procedure, and due to the large number of samples to be inspected, a queue forms in the QC department. If the machine producing the defect is inspected late, the damage caused might be large. This paper proposes the application of data mining tools in order to cluster the machines into groups. After that, the inspection order can be arranged so that the samples from the machines that have the highest tendency to produce a defect can be inspected early. In this study, actual data was used from the production process in the case study company to demonstrate the proposed method. The results suggest that the proposed method helps to detect faulty machines earlier hence reducing the number of defects found in the production line.","Data mining; Hard disk drive; Simple additive weight",,,,,,,"Feelders, A., Daniels, H., Holsheimer, M., Methodological and Practical Aspects of Data Mining (2000) Inform.

Structural equation modeling employs a sample of 310 companies from different industries from the USA, Europe, Canada, Brazil and China. The findings suggest the existence of a statistically significant relationship between analytical capabilities and performance. The moderation effect of information systems support is considerably stronger than the effect of business process orientation. The results provide a better understanding of the areas where the impact of business analytics may be the strongest. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The selected rules have been used to predict the maintenance and rehabilitation strategy of road segments. A pavement database covering four counties within the state of North Carolina, which was provided by North Carolina DOT (NCDOT), has been used to test this method. A comparison was conducted in this paper for the decisions related to a rehabilitation strategy proposed by the NCDOT to the proposed methodology presented in this paper. From the experimental results, it was found that the rehabilitation strategy derived by this paper is different from that proposed by the NCDOT. After combining with the AIRA Data Mining method, seven final rules are defined. Using these final rules, the maps of several pavement rehabilitation strategies are created. When their numbers and locations are compared with ones made by engineers at the Institute for Transportation Research and Education (ITRE) at North Carolina State University, it has been found that error for the number and the location are various for the different rehabilitation strategies. With the pilot experiment in the project, it can be concluded: (1) use of the DMKD method for the decision of road maintenance and rehabilitation can greatly increase the speed of decision making, thus largely saving time and money, and shortening the project period; (2) the DMKD technology can make consistent decisions about road maintenance and rehabilitation if the road conditions are similar, i.e., interference from human factors is less significant; (3) integration of the DMKD and GIS technologies provides a pavement management system with the capabilities to graphically display treatment decisions against distresses; and (4) the decisions related to pavement rehabilitation made by the DMKD technology is not completely consistent with that made by ITRE, thereby, the postprocessing for verification and refinement is necessary. © 2010 ASCE.","Data mining; GIS; Pavement distress; Pavement management","Data mining and knowledge discovery; Data mining methods; Data mining techniques; Data mining technology; GIS technology; Human factors; Investment decisions; Maintenance strategies; Mining algorithms; North Carolina; North Carolina State University; Pavement distress; Pavement management; Pavement management systems; Pavement rehabilitation; Pilot experiment; Rehabilitation strategy; Research efforts; Road condition; Road maintenance; Road segments; Transportation research; Associative processing; Data mining; Decision trees; Geographic information systems; Highway administration; Human engineering; Investments; Location; Maintenance; Pavement overlays; Research; Technology; Roads and streets; algorithm; data mining; data processing; database; decision making; GIS; maintenance; pavement; strategic approach; North Carolina; United States",,,,,,"(1999) AASHTO guidelines for pavement management system, , AASHTO, AASHTO, Washington, D.C; (2001) Pavement management guide, , AASHTO, AASHTO, Washington, D.C; Abkowitz, M., Walsh, S., Hauser, E., Minor, L., Adaptation of geographic information systems to highway management (1990) J.

With reference to the EKB model specific to consumer behavior, this paper discusses the relationship among consumption characteristics, firm selection behavior and satisfaction degree of refurbishment customers. 242 valid questionnaire copies were collected from refurbishment customers, and analyzed using Decision Tree Analysis and Association Rules in Data Mining. The research results show that, over half of the customers tend to entrust the refurbishment to well-reputed firms. Moreover, the integrity of refurbishment equipment, response of refurbishment personnel, professionalism and confidence are key elements in service quality (SQ). The best marketing policy for the customers is one which provides more attractive services. These research findings may provide a useful reference for innovative refurbishment firms in their decision-making.","Business strategy; Consumer behavior; Datamining; EKB model; Refurbishment industry; Service quality","Business strategy; Consumer behavior; Consumer behaviors; EKB model; Service Quality; Associative processing; Data mining; Decision trees; Quality of service; Research; Sales; Strategic planning; Customer satisfaction",,,,,,"Aikivuori, A., Periods and demand for private sector housing refurbishment (1996) Construction Management and Economics, 14 (1), pp. 3-12. , doi:10.1080/01446199600000002; (2009), http://www.dgbas.gov.tw/census~n/six/lue5/cen8904.rtf, Census Bureau, Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, Executive Yuan, cited Sept 20, Available from InternetChua, M.L., Lan, J.H., Information and information for supporting collaborative design (2005) Automation in Construction, 14, pp. 197-205. , doi:10.1016/j.autcon. 2004.07.011; Cronin Jr., J., Taylor, S.A., Measuring service quality: Are examination and extension (1992) Journal of Marketing, 56 (3), pp. 56-68. , doi:10.2307/1252296; Egbu, C.O., Young, B.A., Torrnace, V.B., Refurbishment management practices in the shipping and construction industries-lessons to be learned (1996) Building Research and Information, 24 (6), pp. 329-338. , doi:10.1080/09613219608727553; Engel, J.F., Kollat, D.T., Blackwell, R.D., (2001) Consumer Behavior, , New Jersey: South-Western; Fayyad, U.G., Shapiro, G.P., Smyth, P., The KDD process for extracting useful knowledge from volumes of data (1996) Communication of the ACM, 39 (11), pp. 27-34. , doi:10.1145/240455.240464; Gaski, J.F., Micheal, J.E., The index of consumer sentiment toward marketing (1986) Journal of Marketing, 50, pp. 71-81. , doi:10.2307/1251586; Han, J., Kamber, M., (2000) Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques, , San Francisco: Morgan Kaufmann Publisher; Hsieh, L.F., Lin, L.H., Lin, Y.Y., A service quality measurement architecture for hot spring hotels in Taiwan (2008) Tourism Management, 29, pp. 429-438. , doi:10.1016/j.tourman. 2007.05.009; Huang, C.F., Wang, T.W., A study on innovative business models of refurbishment industry (2005) Journal of Architecture, 54, pp. 91-113. , Nov.:, in Chinese; Hui, S.C., Jha, G., Data mining for customer service support (2000) Information and Management, 38 (1), pp. 1-13. , doi:10.1016/S0378-7206 00 00051-3; Johns, M., Customer satisfaction: The case for measurement (1995) Journal of Audiovisual Media in Medicine, 18 (1), pp. 17-32; Johnstone, I.M., Periodic refurbishment and reductions in national costs to sustain dwelling service (2001) Construction Management and Economics, 19, pp. 97-108. , doi:10.1080/01446190010003434; Juan, Y.K., A hybrid approach using data envelopment analysis and case-based reasoning for housing refurbishment contractors selection and performance improvement (2009) Expert Systems with Applications, 36, pp. 5702-5710. , doi:10.1016/j.eswa.2008.06.053; Kaklauskas, A., Zavadskas, E.K., Raslanas, S., Multivariant design and multiple criteria analysis of building refurbishments (2005) Energy and Buildings, 37, pp. 361-372. , doi:10.1016/j.enbuild.2004.07.005; Kiselev, M.V., Poly-analyst 2.0: Combination of statistical data preprocessing and symbolic KDD technique (1995) Proc. of ECML-95 Workshop on Statistics, Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases, pp. 187-192. , in; Kleissner, C., Data mining for the enterprise (1998) IEEE Proc. of the 31st Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 7, pp. 295-304. , in, doi:10.1109/HICSS.1998.649224; Lee, J.R., Hsueh, S.L., Tseng, H.P., Utilizing datamining to discover knowledge in construction enterprise performance records (2008) Journal of Civil Engineering and Management, 14 (2), pp. 79-84. , doi:10.3846/1392-3730.2008.14.2; Mickaityte, A., Zavadskas, E.K., Kaklauskas, A., Tupenaite, L., The concept model of sustainable buildings refurbishment (2008) International Journal of Strategic Property Management, 12, pp. 53-68. , doi:10.3846/1648-715X.2008.12.53-68; Moschis, G.P., Gilbert, A., Churchill, Jr., Consumer socialization: A theoretical and empirical analysis (1978) Journal of Marketing Research, 15 (4), pp. 599-609. , doi:10.2307/3150629; Parasuraman, A., Zeithaml, V.A., Berry, L.L., SERVQUAL: A multiple-item scale for measuring consumer perceptions of service quality (1988) Journal of Retailing, 64, pp. 12-40; Regan, W.J., The service revolution (1963) Journal of Marketing, 27, pp. 32-36. , doi:10.2307/1249437; Thuraisingham, B., A primer for understanding and applying data mining (2000) IT Professional, 2 (1), pp. 28-31. , doi:10.1109/6294.819936; Williamson, O.E., (1975) Markets and Hierarchies: Analysis and Antitrust Implications, , New York: Free Press","Huang, C.-F.; Department of Civil Engineering, National Kaohsiung University of Applied SciencesTaiwan; email: jeffrey@cc.kuas.edu.tw",,,,,,,,13923730,,,,"English","J.

This paper addresses the problem of manufacturing cell formation using a modified particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The main modification that this work made to the original PSO algorithm consists in not using the vector of velocities that the standard PSO algorithm does. The proposed algorithm uses the concept of proportional likelihood with modifications, a technique that is used in data mining applications. Some simulation results are presented and compared with results from literature. The criterion used to group the machines into cells is based on the minimization of intercell movements. The computational results show that the PSO algorithm is able to find the optimal solutions in almost all instances, and its use in machine grouping problems is feasible. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Examples are line defects, point defects, and Mura defects. Engineers rely on personal experience for trouble shooting during TFT-LCD manufacture, which does not quickly locate possible fault root causes using their own domain knowledge or rules of thumb. In a fully automated manufacturing environment in TFT-LCD factories, large amounts of raw data are increasingly accumulated from various sources, automatically or semi-automatically, for fault diagnosis and process monitoring. This study aims to propose a data mining framework for diagnosing the root causes of defects in factories. The extracted information and knowledge is helpful to engineers as a basis for trouble shooting and defect diagnosis. To examine the validity of this approach, an empirical study was conducted in a TFT-LCD company in Taiwan, and the results demonstrated the practical viability of this approach. © 2010 Chinese Institute of Industrial Engineers.","data mining;

And we know the risk decision-making is an important aspect in the management practice. In the risk decision process of a project decision-making, it is necessary to use the algorithm to discover valuable knowledge and make a right decision. In the paper, a data mining method called Rough Sets is introduced in the field. And the algorithmic process of data mining based on Rough Set is studied. According to the Rough Sets theory, firstly, the factors set is established including condition attribute and decision attribute. Secondly, experts qualitatively describe risk factors and establish a decision database, called decision table. Thirdly, the attribute reduction algorithm based on Rough Sets is used to eliminate the redundant risk factor and its value of decision table. Fourthly, the minimum decision rules are abstracted based on data mining technology. Finally, the process of risk decision based on data mining of Rough Sets is analyzed in a case study.","Attribute reduction; Data mining; Minimum decision rule; Project decision-making; Risk decision; Rough sets","Attribute reduction; Decision rules; Project decision; Risk decision; Rough set; Algorithms; Data mining; Data reduction; Decision tables; Decision theory; Mining; Rough set theory; Decision making",,,,,,"Lv, A., Lin, Z., Li, C., Approaching of data mining and knowledge discovery [J] (2000) Survey Science, 12 (4), pp. 36-39. , in Chinese; Pawlak., Z., Rough sets (1982) International Journal of Computer and Information Sceinces, 11, pp. 341-356; Dhar, V., Stein, R., Intelligent dicision support methods (1997) The Science of Knowledge Work, , Printice Hall; Wu, Z., Wei, L., Pu, H., Application of wavelet network for detection and localization of power quality disturbances[J] (2006) WAEAS Transactions on Power Systems, 1 (10), pp. 2029-2034; Wu, Z., Wei, L., Pu, H., Early detection for short-circuit fault in distributed power system based on wavelet fractal exponent analysis[J] (2006) WAEAS Transactions on Power Systems, 1 (12), pp. 2035-2040; Lu, Y., Lu, J., (1998) Project Risk Management, , [M] Beijing: Tsinghua University Press in Chinese; Zhuang, E., Wang, M.Z., (1999) Risk Investment and Case Analysis, , [M].Beijing: China Audit Press, .

This work reports our experience in developing a support system aimed to ease the work of the extruder machinist while improving the quality of the profiles obtained. In order to build the system, an approach based on facts was adopted, following ISO 9000 standard quality principles. The data warehouse service available provided a wealth of information on the conditions of the running processes. The collected data, after being analysed with the appropriate data-mining techniques, allowed us to gain a better understanding of the process and to identify the main causes of variance. In particular, principal components analysis, Sammon projection and several classification techniques were applied for exploratory purposes. Different behaviours could be described for the extrusion process, allowing for the definition of a control strategy and, eventually, the development of a manufacturing support system. The estimates displayed by the system greatly improve the responsiveness of the machinist when the process departs from expected behaviour. The results of using this system in a local factory proved highly satisfactory and encouraging. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Multivariate statistics; Neural network applications; Neural networks; New technology management;

Human body type classifications are also very crucial issue for garment manufacturing. Data mining has been widely used in many fields. But, there is lack of research in the area of establishing of garment-sizing systems for business logistics. This research aims to establish sizing systems of body types from the anthropometric data of females by using a fuzzy clustering-based data mining approach. Certain advantages may be observed when the sizing systems are established, using fuzzy clustering-based data mining procedure. Body types could be accurately classified for garment production according the newly the sizing systems. This approach is found to be effective in processing the anthropometric data, and obtaining regular rules for the development of sizing systems. The results of this study can provide an effective procedure of identifying the clusters of human body type to establish the sizing systems for integrating logistics operations internally with different functions inside the organization and also externally with business partners.","Business logistics;

This paper reviews the literature dealing with knowledge discovery and data mining applications in the broad domain of manufacturing with a special emphasis on the type of functions to be performed on the data. The major data mining functions to be performed include characterization and description, association, classification, prediction, clustering and evolution analysis. The papers reviewed have therefore been categorized in these five categories. It has been shown that there is a rapid growth in the application of data mining in the context of manufacturing processes and enterprises in the last 3 years. This review reveals the progressive applications and existing gaps identified in the context of data mining in manufacturing. A novel text mining approach has also been used on the abstracts and keywords of 150 papers to identify the research gaps and find the linkages between knowledge area, knowledge type and the applied data mining tools and techniques. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Data mining;

Box 9001, Beer-Sheva, Israel","In this paper, we present a data mining based methodology for optimizing the outcome of a batch manufacturing process. Predictive data mining techniques are applied to a multi-year set of manufacturing data with the purpose of reducing the variation of a crystal manufacturing process, which suffers from frequent fluctuations of the average outgoing yield. Our study is focused on specific defects that are the most common causes for scraping a manufactured crystal. A set of probabilistic rules explaining the likelihood of each defect as a function of interaction between the controllable variables are induced using the single-target and the multi-target Information Network algorithms. The rules clearly define the worst and the best conditions for the manufacturing process, also providing a complete explanation of all major fluctuations in the outgoing quality observed over the recent years. In addition, we show that an early detection of nearly the same predictive model was possible almost two years before the end of the data collection period, which could save many of the flawed crystals. The paper provides a detailed description of the optimization process, including the decisions taken at various stages and their outcomes.

There is emerging evidence of recent emphasis on organizational factors and a greater shift towards ""IT complementarities"" in which value addition is linked to combining complementary organizational practices with IT investments. Our findings indicate that the set of interrelated organizational practices that complement positively to IT use is different from the set of practices hindering IT use. The presence of clustering among organizational practices clearly implies that some combinations of practices make it difficult to precisely empirical examine. We have found that our technique was able to show some organizational factors may have different pathways to affect organizational performance and such organizational practices have often been overlooked but can play a weak yet non-trivial role in production and organizational processes. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The methodologies describe a data mining project as comprised of a sequence of phases and highlight the particular tasks and their corresponding activities to be performed during each of the phases. It seems that the large number of tasks and activities, often presented in a checklist manner, are cumbersome to implement and may explain why all the recommended tasks are not always formally implemented. Additionally, there is often little guidance provided towards how to implement a particular task. These issues seem to be especially dominant in case of the business understanding phase which is the foundational phase of any data mining project. In this paper, we present an organizationally grounded framework to formally implement the business understanding phase of data mining projects. The framework serves to highlight the dependencies between the various tasks of this phase and proposes how and when each task can be implemented. An illustrative example of a credit scoring application from the financial sector is used to exemplify the tasks discussed in the proposed framework. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Although improved antiemetics are available, clinical inertia, cost concerns in community practices, and perceptions of agent equivalence within a class can hinder the adoption of a newer drug indicated for prevention of both acute and delayed CINV - a newer drug that may provide more healthcare value in terms of patient outcomes and management costs than an older agent whose efficacy is limited to acute CINV. Georgia Cancer Specialists (GCS) is a 30-site community-based group practice that uses electronic medical records (EMRs) to collect information that allows for continuous quality improvement of cancer care. Using EMRs and billing records, GCS examined retrospectively whether using palonosetron rather than ondansetron reduced the incidence of resource-consuming extreme CINV events, including rescue antiemetics and office visits for CINV treatment. Initial use of palonosetron to prevent CINV reduced the incidence of extreme CINV events over a 5-day period by 76% in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and by 54% in highly emetogenic chemotherapy, compared with ondansetron. In more than 3,000 patients evaluated, the use of palonosetron versus ondansetron was associated with an estimated reduction in staff management time totaling approximately 4 work months. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

However, as information is more widely deployed, fewer information users understand how to analyze and visualize the data in the appropriate manner to make sound business decisions. In addition, an individual analysis may lead the user to one or more analyses, or to other information sources such as ERP or CRM system. Structured Analytics provides the means for the organization to define knowledge-based process map of how business experts use certain information and knowledge to make business decisions. Within the framework of Knowledge Management, Structured Analytics provides the means to share the organization experts' knowledge and analysis decision-oriented thought process with other decision makers and analysts using guided and structured business decisionmaking processes. The analysis process map captures the knowledge and thought processes of expert decision makers and provides a dynamic graphical analysis environment that is composed of roleconfigurable and context-based analytics that guide decision-making professionals through specific analysis processes. These powerful analysis maps can reveal correlation across a broad range of business parameters. The analysis map has three essential components: Guided Analysis based on best practices scenarios, shared logic repository, and dynamically interlinked views and reports. Structured analytics can be considered a Knowledge Management framework for building analytic applications to provide the ability to reuse business logic. While the market has not actually defined a requirement for structured analytics, inadequate capture and usage of knowledge by organizations and low user adoption and high abandonment rates of current knowledge-based systems are problems that can be solved by Structured Analytics. The power and dynamic nature of Structured Analytics will lead to the formation a company's Knowledge Expert System that allows organizations to sustain and create competitive advantages. Furthermore, tacit knowledge and cognitive processes can now be captured and shared throughout the organization to create The Intelligent Organization. The foundation of the above research was obtained through several concentrated interviews of large business organizations in the US and Europe regarding their needs and use of knowledge asset. These organizations are: PepsiCo (US), Proctor & Gamble (US), Roche Pharmaceuticals (Germany), Reckitt-Benckiser (UK), Alfa Laval (Sweden), Siemens (Germany), Reuters (England), and ABB (Switzerland). These interviews led the author to the conclusion that organizations of all types require a platform of knowledge capture and use. Thus, every organization needs to become an intelligent organization that capable of continuous value creation and continuous innovations by creating and using corporate-wide knowledge base. This will naturally leads the intelligent organization to become an innovator in its space and other spaces. © 2009 WASET.ORG.","Analytical patterns; Business Analytics; Business Intelligence; Data Mining; Forecasting; Guided Analytics; Intellectual Capital; Intelligent Organization; Knowledge Informatics; Knowledge Management; Optimization; Structured Analytics","Analytical patterns; Business Analytics; Business Intelligence; Guided Analytics; Intellectual Capital; Intelligent Organization; Knowledge Informatics; Structured Analytics; Competition; Data mining; Dynamic analysis; Electric load forecasting; Expert systems; Innovation; Knowledge management; Management science; Mining; Security of data; Societies and institutions; Decision making",,,,,,"Cleary, Thomas, Sun Tzu, A translation by Thomas Cleary (2003) The Art of War: Complete Text And Commentary, Shambhala Publications, BostonCollin, J., (2001) Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap ⋯ and Others Don't, , Collin Business Press, USA; Hamel, G., Prahalad, C.K., (1996) Competing for the Future, , Harvard Business School Press, Boston; Argote, L., Ingram, P., (2000) Knowledge Transfer: A Basis for Competitive Advantage in Firms Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 82 (1), pp. 150-169. , May, pp; Epple, D., Argote, L., Murphy, K., An empirical investigation of the micro structure of knowledge acquisition and transfer through learning by doing (1996) Operations Research, 44, pp. 77-86; Galbraith, C.S., Transferring core manufacturing technologies in high technology firms (1990) California Management Review, 32 (4), pp. 56-70; Baum, J.A.C., Ingram, P., Survival-enhancing learning in the Manhattan hotel industry, 1898-1980, Management (1998) Science, 44, pp. 996-1016; Darr, E., Argote, L., Epple, D., The acquisition, transfer and depreciation of knowledge in service organizations: Productivity in franchises (1995) Management Science, 41, pp. 1750-1762; Argote, L., (1999) Organizational learning: Creating, retaining, and transferring knowledge, , Norwell, MA: Kluwer; Argote, L., McGrath, J.E., Group processes in organizations: Continuity and change (1993) International Review of Industrial and Organizational Psychology, 8, pp. 333-389; Arrow, H., McGrath, J.E., Berdahl, J.L., (2000) Small groups as complex systems: Formation, coordination, development and adaptation, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Levitt, B., March, J.G., Organizational learning (1988) Annual Review of Sociology, 14, pp. 319-340; McGrath, J.E., Time, interaction, and performance (TIP): A theory of groups (1991) Small Group Research, 22, pp. 147-174; Starbuck, W.H., Learning by knowledge-intensive firms (1992) Journal of Management Studies, 29, pp. 713-738; Walsh, J.P., Ungson, G.R., Organizational memory (1991) Academy of Management Review, 16, pp. 57-91","Dayyani, B.; Information Technology Associate, American University in Dubai, Dubai, United Arab Emirates; email: bdayyani@aud.edu",,,,,,,,2010376X,,,,"English","World Acad.

Quick and correct identification of the bottleneck locations can lead to an improvement in the operation management of utilising finite manufacturing resources, increasing the system throughput, and minimising the total cost of production. Most of the current bottleneck detection schemes focus on the long-term bottleneck detection problem and an analytical or simulation model is usually needed. Due to recent developments, short-term process control and quick decision making on the plant floor have emerged as important qualities for operation management. This research proposes a new data driven method for throughput bottleneck detection in both the short and long term. The method utilises the production line blockage and starvation probabilities and buffer content records to identify the production constraints without building an analytical or simulation model. The method has been verified both analytically and by simulation. An industrial case study has also been used in order to demonstrate the implementation and validate the efficiency of the proposed bottleneck detection method.","Bottleneck; Data driven; Short term; Turning point","Bottleneck detection; Bottleneck location; Data driven; Data-driven methods; Industrial case study; Long term; Manufacturing resource; Manufacturing system; Operation management; Plant floors; Production constraints; Production line; Short term; Simulation model; System throughput; Total costs; Turning points; Inspection; Simulators; Turning; Throughput",,,,,,"Alden, J.M., General Motors increases its production throughput (2006) Interfaces, 36 (1), pp. 6-25; Blumenfeld, D.E., Li, J., An analytical formula for throughput of a production line with identical stations and random failures (2005) Mathematical Problems in Engineering, 2005 (3), pp. 293-308; Bonder, D.A., McGinnis, L.F., A structured approach to simulation modeling of manufacturing systems (2002) Proceedings of the 2002 Industrial Engineering Research Conference, pp. 1-6. , 19-21 May, Orlando Florida; Buzacott, J.A., Shanthikumar, J.G., (1993) Stochastic Models of Manufacturing Systems, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall; Chang, Q., (2005) Supervisory Factory Control Based on Real-time Production Feedback, , Thesis (PhD).

The performance of several types of data mining tool, such as artificial neural networks, support vector machines, regression trees, classification trees, and a naïve Bayesian classifier, is compared. Also, some simple non-parametric statistical methods, based on an analysis of variance (ANOVA) and contingency tables, are evaluated for comparison purposes. The tests were performed using simulated data sets, with assumed hidden relationships, as well as on real data collected in the foundry industry. It was found that the performance of significance and interaction factors obtained from regression models, and, in particular, neural networks, is satisfactory, while the other methods appeared to be less accurate and or/less reliable.© IMechE 2008.","Data mining; Learning systems; Manufacturing process parameters; Regression models; Significance analysis; Statistical methods","Bayesian networks; Data mining; Decision support systems; Flow interactions; Industrial engineering; Information management; Knowledge management; Neural networks; Production engineering; Regression analysis; Statistical methods; Statistics; Support vector machines; Trees (mathematics); Artificial neural networks; Bayesian classifiers; Classification trees; Contingency tables; Foundry industries; Generalized regressions; Industrial problems; Interaction factors; Manufacturing process parameters; Manufacturing processes; Process parameters; Process variables; Product qualities; Real datums; Regression models; Regression trees; Root causes; Significance analysis; Simulated data sets; Support vectors; Analysis of variance (ANOVA)",,,,,,"Shahbaz, M., Srinivas, M., Harding, J.

Data-driven decision making (DDDM) has become an emerging field of practice for school leadership and a central focus of education policy and practice. Purpose: This study examined principals' DDDM practices and identified the factors influencing DDDM using the theoretical frame of information use environments. Participants: Participants were 183 public high school principals in a Midwestern state. Research Design: The research design was cross-sectional survey research. Data Collection and Analysis: Survey instruments were developed and administered to principals. Structural equation modeling was conducted to determine what factors significantly affect principals' DDDM practices in different leadership dimensions. Findings: Principals used data more frequently in instructional and organization operational leadership than in the leadership dimensions of school vision and collaborative partnerships. Different contextual factors affected data use in different leadership dimensions. Human-related factors such as perceptions of data quality and data analysis skills seemed to have direct effects on data use in addressing administrative problems in instruction and organizational operation, in which data were used frequently. Organization-related factors such as school district requirement and accessibility of data tended to have more direct influence on data use in the leadership dimensions of school vision and collaborative partnerships, where data were used less often. Conclusions: This study supports the proposition that as information behavior, DDDM is situational, multidimensional, and dynamic. Results provide insights into practice, research, and theoretical foundation for the emerging topic of DDDM. © 2008 The University Council for Educational Administration.","Data; Data-driven decision making; Information use environment; Leadership dimension; Principal",,,,,,,"Agor, W.H., (1986) The Logic of Intuitive Decision Making: A Research-based Approach for Top Management, , New York: Quorum; (2002) Using Data to Improve Schools: What's Working, , http://www.aasa.org/cas/UsingDataToImproveSchools.pdf, American Association of School Administrators (AASA); Armstrong, J., Anthes, K., Identifying the factors, conditions, and policies that support schools' use of data for decision making and school improvement: Summary of findings (2001) Retrieved, , http://www.ecs.org/clearinghouse/30/69/3069.doc; Baker, B.D., Richards, C.E., (2004) The Ecology of Educational Systems: Data, Models, and Tools for Improvisational Leading and Learning, , Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education; Bennet, A., Alive with the Fire of Shared Understanding: Implementing Knowledge Management in the Department of the Navy (2004) Knowledge Management Lesson Learned: What Works and What Doesn't, pp. 279-292. , M.

Since many organizations do not possess the in-house expertise of data mining, it is beneficial to outsource data mining tasks to external service providers. However, most organizations hesitate to do so due to the concern of loss of business intelligence and customer privacy. In this paper, we present a Bloom filter based solution to enable organizations to outsource their tasks of mining association rules, at the same time, protect their business intelligence and customer privacy.

We apply principal-agent theory to the analysis of qualitative data gathered in a case study of 4 urban school systems. Our findings suggest educators at the school level need not only systemic support but also enough decision-making autonomy to make site-level decisions on the basis of data. Secondly, we found that building expertise and capacity at the school site for data-driven decision-making is necessary but not a sufficient condition for success. Finally, in designing an accountability system, the imbalance in the distribution of information between the central office and the schools must be accommodated. Implications for further research and policy, based on these findings, are also discussed.","Accountability; Data-driven decision-making; Education reform; Principal-agent theory; School improvement; Urban education",,,,,,,"Alwin, L., The will and the way of data use (2002) School Administrator, 59 (11), p. 11; Borja, R.R., District initiative (2006) Education Week, 25 (35), pp. 24-41; Brown, B.D., Principals, bureaucrats, and responsiveness in clean air enforcement (1998) American Political Science Review, 82, pp. 213-234; (2004) From the capital to the classroom: Year 2 of the No Child Left Behind Act, , Center on Education Policy, Washington, DC: Author; Colby, S., Smith, K., Shelton, J., (2005) Expanding the supply of high quality public schools, , San Francisco: The Bridgespan group; Crommey, A., (2000) Using student assessment data: What can we learn from schools, , Oak Brook, IL: North Central Regional Educational Laboratory; Datnow, A., Park, V., Wohlstetter, P., (2007) Achieving with data: How high performing elementary school systems use data to improve instruction for elementary school students, , http://www.usc.edu/dept/education/cegov/achieving_data.pdf, Los Angeles: USC Center on Educational Governance.

Recent discussions in this field state that DM does not contribute to business in a large-scale. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the importance of business insiders in the process of knowledge development to make DM more relevant to business. Design/methodology/ approach - This paper proposes a blog-based model of knowledge sharing system to support the DM process for effective BI. Findings - Through an illustrative case study, the paper has demonstrated the usefulness of the model of knowledge sharing system for DM in the dynamic transformation of explicit and tacit knowledge for BI. DM can be an effective BI tool only when business insiders are involved and organizational knowledge sharing is implemented. Practical implications - The structure of blog-based knowledge sharing systems for DM process can be practically applied to enterprises for BI. Originality/value - The paper suggests that any significant DM process in the BI context must involve data miner centered DM cycle and business insider centered knowledge development cycle. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Blogs; Business intelligence; Data mining; Knowledge management; Knowledge sharing","Administrative data processing; Bismuth; Bismuth plating; Computer networks; Data mining; Database systems; Decision support systems; Dynamic models; Dynamical systems; Industrial management; Industry; Information management; Information technology; Internet; Knowledge management; Management; Management information systems; Management science; Mathematical models; Mining; Paper; Search engines; (e ,3e) process; Applied (CO); Business Intelligence (BI); case studies; Data miners; Data mining processes; dynamic transformations; field states; knowledge development; Knowledge discovery (KDD); knowledge sharing; Knowledge sharing systems; Organizational knowledge sharing; Practical implications; Tacit knowledge; Knowledge based systems",,,,,,"Berry, M.J.A., Linoff, G.S., (2000) Mastering Data Mining, , Wiley New York, NY; Brachman, R.J., Khabaza, T., Kloesgen, W., Piatetsky-Shapiro, G., Simoudis, E., Mining business databases (1996) Communications of the ACM, 39 (11), pp. 42-8; Buckman, R.H., (2004) Building A Knowledge-Driven Organizations, , McGraw Hill New York, NY; Chen, S.Y., Liu, X., Data mining from 1994 to 2004: An application-oriented review (2005) International Journal of Business Intelligence and Data Mining, 1 (1), pp. 4-11; Cody, W.F., Kreulen, J.T., Krishna, V., Spangler, W.S., The integration of business intelligence and knowledge management (2002) IBM Systems Journal, 41 (4), pp. 697-713; Cook, C., Cook, M., (2000) The Convergence of Knowledge Management and Business Intelligence, , Auerbach Publications New York, NY; Davenport, T.H., Seely, C.P., KM meets business intelligence: Merging knowledge and information at Intel (2006) Knowledge Management Review, pp. 10-15. , January/February; Fayyad, U., Piatetsky-Shapiro, G., Smyth, P., The KDD process for extracting useful knowledge from volumes of data (1996) Communications of the ACM, 39 (11), pp. 7-34; Feng, D., Chen, E.T., Firm performance effects in relations to the implementation and use of knowledge management systems (2007) International Journal of Innovation and Learning, 4 (2), pp. 172-85; Foley, K., Knowledge management key to collaboration (2001) InformationWeek, 857, p. 78. , October 1; Glass, R.I., What's with this blog thing?

The software packages for data analysis have two major shortcomings: (1) solutions are not offered as a service reachable by standard procedures over the Internet, but as isolated standalone applications or ERP system modules; (2) privacy restrictions need to be integrated into a framework of business analytics for Web retailers. The first aspect can be addressed with standardized developer software for Web services, but the second must consider privacy legislation, privacy specifications on Web sites (P3P), and data reidentification problems. These shortcomings are addressed by a proposed formal model of these problems and an implementation of the model as a declarative specification of privacy constraints, expressed as an extension of P3P. The constraints are complemented by a logic identifying the elements in a given set of Web analytics that might lead to data reidentification and therefore violate implicit privacy constraints. A Web-based service is presented that uses these components to automatically adapt the set of available Web analytics to an on-line retailer's P3P policy. The system was tested on a large data set from a major European multichannel retailer. Copyright © 2008 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.

One encounters a not-so-perfect database from which data is missing, and the results obtained from such a database may provide biased or misleading solutions. Therefore, imputing missing data to a database has been regarded as one of the major steps in data mining. The present research used different methods of data mining to construct imputative models in accordance with different types of missing data. When the missing data is continuous, regression models and Neural Networks are used to build imputative models. For the categorical missing data, the logistic regression model, neural network, C5.0 and CART are employed to construct imputative models. The results showed that the regression model was found to provide the best estimate of continuous missing data; but for categorical missing data, the C5.0 model proved the best method. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","BPNN; C5.0; Data mining; Imputation; Missing data; Regression","Database systems; Mathematical models; Regression analysis; Societies and institutions; Imputative models; Missing data; Data mining",,,,,,"Alan, A., (1996) An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis, , Wiley Interscience; Craven, M.P., A faster learning neural network classifier using selective backpropagation (1997) Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems.

The clustering results, together with domain expertise, are used to build a meaningful project taxonomy that can be linked to project resource requirements. Such a linkage is essential for project-based workforce demand forecasting, a key input for more advanced workforce management decision support. We formulate the problem as a sequence clustering problem where each sequence represents a project and each observation in the sequence represents the weekly distribution of project labor hours across job role categories. To solve the problem, we use a model-based clustering algorithm based on explicit state duration left-right hidden semi-Markov models (HsMM) capable of handling high-dimensional, sparse, and noisy Dirichlet-distributed observations and sequences of widely varying lengths. We then present an approach for using the underlying cluster models to estimate future staffing needs. The approach is applied to a set of 250 IT consulting projects and the results discussed. © 2008 The authors and IOS Press.

This involves internal audits and analysis by business controls personnel to identify fraud and misuse and to take appropriate corrective actions. We have developed a set of statistical models to identify suspicious behavior for further investigation. Our Behavioral Shift Models (BSM) leverage domain knowledge in the form of simple, generic templates that represent classes of fraud and abuse. The emphasis is on robustly detecting repeated, out-of-the-norm behaviors as opposed to single instance occurrences. In this paper, we describe the application of these models and characterize their detection capabilities empirically. We also present validated results and insights generated by our approach when applied to production data from multiple firms for several T&E scenarios. © 2007, Australian Computer Society, Inc.","Audits; Business controls; Fraud and abuse","Audits; Business control; Corporate travel; Corrective actions; Detection capability; Domain knowledge; Fraud and abuse; Generic templates; Internal audit; Production data; Statistical models; Validated results; Computer crime; Crime; Data mining; Industry; Knowledge management; Management",,,,,,"Beasley, M.S., Carcello, J.V., Hermanson, D.R., Top 10 Audit Deficiencies (2001) Journal of Accountancy, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants; Bolton, R.J., Hand, D.J., Statistical Fraud Detection: A Review (with discussion) (2002) Statistical Science, 17 (3), pp. 235-255; Bolton, R.J., Hand, D.J., Unsupervised Profiling Methods for Fraud Detection (2001) Credit Scoring and Credit Control VII, , Edinburgh, UK; Christianini, N., Shawe-Taylor, J., (2000) Support Vector Machines, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Denning, D.E., An Intrusion-Detection Model (1987) IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, SE-13 (2); Duda, R.O., Hart, P.E., Stork, D.S., (2001) Pattern Classification, , John Wiley & Sons; http://www-935.ibm.com/services/us/index.wss/offering/igs/a1009035, GERS: IBM Global Expense Reporting SolutionsGlaz, J., Naus, J., Wallenstein, S., (2001) Scan Statistics, , Springer-Verlag New York; Hodge, V.J., Austin, J., A Survey of Outlier Detection Methodologies (2004) AI Review 2004, 22, pp. 85-126; Huang, L., Kulldorff, M., Gregorio, D., A Spatial Scan Statistic for Survival Data (2007) Biometrics, 63 (1), pp. 109-118; Kulldorff, M., A Spatial Scan Statistic (1997) Communications in Statistics: Theory and Methods, 26, pp. 1481-1496; Lehmann, L.E., (1986) Testing Statistical Hypothesis, , Springer-Verlag, New York; http://www.nbta.org/About/TheValueofManagedTravel, National Business Travel Association (NBTA)Williams, G., Baxter, R., He, H., Hawkins, S., Gu, L., (2002) A Comparative Study of RNN for Outlier Detection in Data Mining, , International Conference of Data Mining & CSIRO Technical Report CMIS02/102","Iyengar, V.; IBM Thomas J.

It is likely that useful knowledge can be extracted from these databases. This paper argues that applying data mining algorithms together with Game Theory poses a significant potential as a new way to analyze complex engineering systems, such as strategy selection in manufacturing analysis. Recent research shows that combining data mining and Game Theory has not yet come up with reasonable solutions for the representation and structuring of the knowledge in a game. In order to examine the idea, a novel approach of fusing these two techniques has been developed in this paper and tested on real-world manufacturing datasets. The obtained results have been indicated the superiority of the proposed approach.

However, in high-tech industry such as semiconductor manufacturing, many factors that are interrelated affect the yield of fabricated wafers. Engineers who rely on personal domain knowledge cannot find possible root causes of defects rapidly and effectively. This study aims to develop a framework for data mining and knowledge discovery from database that consists of a Kruskal-Wallis test, K-means clustering, and the variance reduction splitting criterion to investigate the huge amount of semiconductor manufacturing data and infer possible causes of faults and manufacturing process variations. The extracted information and knowledge is helpful to engineers as a basis for trouble shooting and defect diagnosis. We validated this approach with an empirical study in a semiconductor foundry company in Taiwan and the results demonstrated the practical viability of this approach. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Those potential intelligences behind manufacturing processes should hold the information about process improvement or product development. Namely, mining such manufacturing intelligence will have positive contribution to enterprise's core competition.

To this end, this paper develops a new decision-theoretic classification framework and applies it to a real-world semiconductor wafer manufacturing line that suffers from constant variations in the characteristics of the chip-manufacturing process. The decision-theoretic framework is based on a model for evaluating classifiers in terms of their value in decision-making. Recognizing that in many practical applications the values of the class probabilities as well as payoffs are neither static nor known exactly, a precise condition under which one classifier 'dominates' another classifier (i.e. achieves higher payoff), regardless of payoff or class distribution information, is presented. Building on the decision-theoretic model, two robust ensemble classification methods are proposed that construct composite classifiers that are at least as good as any of the existing component classifiers for all possible payoff functions and class distributions. It is shown how these two robust ensemble classifiers are put into practice by developing decision rules for effectively monitoring and controlling the real-world semiconductor wafer fabrication line under study.","Actionable data mining; Cost-sensitive classification; Decision theory; Ensemble classification; Knowledge discovery; Semiconductor manufacturing; Stochastic yield","Classification (of information); Decision making; Decision theory; Microprocessor chips; Process control; Random processes; Semiconductor device manufacture; Silicon wafers; Ensemble classification; Semiconductor manufacturing control; Semiconductor wafer manufacturing; Stochastic yield; Data mining",,,,,,"Adams, N.M., Hand, D.J., Comparing classifiers when the misallocation costs are uncertain (1999) Patt.

Companies compete with each other by continuously employing new technologies, increasing yield, and reducing costs. Yield improvement is increasingly important as advanced fabrication technologies are complicated and interrelated. In particular, wafer bin maps (WBM) that present specific failure patterns provide crucial information to track the process problems in semiconductor manufacturing, yet most fabrication facility (fabs) rely on experienced engineers' judgments of the map patterns through eye-ball analysis. Thus, existing studies are subjective, time consuming, and are also restricted by the capability of human recognition. This study proposes a hybrid data mining approach that integrates spatial statistics and adaptive resonance theory neural networks to quickly extract patterns from WBM and associate with manufacturing defects. An empirical study of WBM clustering was conducted in a fab for validation. The results showed practical viability of the proposed approach and now an expert system embedded with the developed algorithm has been implemented in a fab in Taiwan. This study concludes with a discussion on further research. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

It facilitates interpretation and development of new theoretical concepts. This is demonstrated by a data set of 11 barley mutant endosperm genes and crosses focusing on the extremely high mutant gene discrimination capability by Near Infrared Reflection Spectroscopy (NIRS). It represents patterns of intact chemical bonds from self-organised endosperm tissues, which are validated to prior spectroscopic, chemical and genetic knowledge. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of spectra could classify different endosperm mutant genes and changed gene backgrounds. A new carbohydrate pathway regulation from starch to β-glucan was identified. Specific mutant genes were defined visually by directly inspecting and validating spectral patterns from genetically defined barleys. Genetic concepts such as ""the phenome"" and ""pleiotropy"" were given new definitions, phenomenologically expressed as log1/R MSC (Multiple Scatter Corrected) NIRS fingerprints comparing mutants in an iso-genic background. Chemometric models are efficient in over-viewing genetic and environmental spectral differences but are not able to reproduce and predict in detail the finely tuned spectra from the ""natural computer"" of the self-organising tissue. Thus it is always necessary to return to spectral data for a final visual evaluation. In statistics and chemometrics mathematical formalism in data modelling should be integrated with the chemical and biological meaning of data-patterns. Ideas for problem solution may be combined from both sides. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Polysemic English loan words are particularly problematic in translation, as their meanings do not always match across donor and receptor languages. An Anglicism may, for example, convey a subset of the senses expressed by the same word in English and/or it may convey meanings typically expressed by a synonymous English word. It is no wonder that translator trainees often get into difficulty when having to decide whether and how to translate an English word with an established Anglicism in Italian. This tutorial presents a corpus-based teaching methodology that draws on the data-learning approach devised by Tim Johns and aims to equip translator trainees with a kit of analytical tools for better understanding Anglicisms in cross- and inter-linguistic professional communication so that they can produce accurate and effective translations. After briefly reviewing recent studies of Anglicisms in Italian, I outline the main features of the proposed educational methodology and illustrate how it has been applied to the analysis of the lemma business in the Language for Specific Purposes (LSP) translation classroom. © 2006 IEEE.","Anglicism; Borrowing; Comparable corpus; Concordance; Data-driven learning; Frequency list; Loan word; Parallel corpus; Translation","Linguistics; Teaching; Translation (languages); Anglicism; Business communication; Data-driven learning; Technical writing",,,,,,"Pulcini, V., ""Italian"" (2002) English in Europe, pp. 151-167. , in M.

It is highly desirable to develop a methodology of variation source identification that helps quickly identify the variation sources, hence leading to quality improvement and cost reduction in manufacturing systems. This paper presents a variation source identification method based on the analysis of the covariance matrix of process quality measurements. The identification procedure utilizes the fact that the eigenspace of the quality measurement covariance matrix can be decomposed into a subspace due to variation sources and a subspace purely due to system noise. The former subspaces for different samples will be the same if the same variation sources dominate. A testing procedure is presented, which can determine the closeness of the subspaces under sampling uncertainty. A case study is conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of this methodology. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Eigenspace; Factor analysis; Principal component analysis; Variation reduction; Variation source identification","Matrix algebra;

The proposed prediction adopts the Kalman-Filter as the basic prediction scheme and possesses two characteristics stated below. One is the state-space built with the principal component time-series integrated with time-series PCA (Principal Component Method) from multi business indices related to the targeted time-series. The other is the self-organised auto-updating of the state-space by structured neural networks. The proposed scheme shows considerably more accurate prediction than any other models with single variable time-series and the obvious effect appears to be the high accuracy achieved by adopting time-series PCA as a Data-Mining technique. Given these results, the proposed prediction scheme might be considered to improve stable electric power supply and accommodation. This prediction scheme can be applied to various management areas, and so it might be considered to be an effective method for decision-making support.

These patterns can be used, for example, to improve manufacturing quality. However, data accumulated in manufacturing plants have unique characteristics, such as unbalanced distribution of the target attribute, and a small training set relative to the number of input features. Thus, conventional methods are inaccurate in quality improvement cases. Recent research shows, however, that a decomposition tactic may be appropriate here and this paper presents a new feature set decomposition methodology that is capable of dealing with the data characteristics associated with quality improvement. In order to examine the idea, a new algorithm called (Breadth-Oblivious-Wrapper) BOW has been developed. This algorithm performs a breadth first search while using a new F-measure splitting criterion for multiple oblivious trees. The new algorithm was tested on various real-world manufacturing datasets, specifically the food processing industry and integrated circuit fabrication. The obtained results have been compared to other methods, indicating the superiority of the proposed methodology. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2006.","Data mining; F-measure; Feature set-decomposition; Quality engineering; Splitting criterion","Algorithms; Database systems; Manufacturing data processing; Quality assurance; Trees (mathematics); F-measure; Feature set-decomposition; Quality engineering; Splitting criterion; Data mining",,,,,,"Bellman, R., (1961) Adaptive Control Processes: A Guided Tour, , NJ: Princeton University Press; Chawla, N.V., Bowyer, K.W., Hall, L.O., Kegelmeyer, W.P., SMOTE: Synthetic minority over-sampling technique (2002) Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 16, pp. 321-357; Duda, R., Hart, P., (1973) Pattern Classification and Scene Analysis, , New-York: Wiley; Dunteman, G.H., (1989) Principal Components Analysis, , CA, Beverley Hills: Sage Publications; Estabrooks, A., Jo, T., Japkowicz, N., A multiple resampling method for learning from imbalances data sets (2004) Computational Intelligence, 20 (1), pp. 18-36; Ferri, C., Flach, P., Hernández-Orallo, J., Learning decision trees using the area under the ROC curve (2002) Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 139-146. , C.

Practitioners in academia and the business world have developed a number of methodologies to support this competitive restructuring that forms the current focus of concern, many of which have not been successful. The purpose of this paper is to suggest the use of data mining (DM) as a technique to support the process of redesigning a business by extracting the much needed knowledge hidden in large volumes of data maintained by the organization through the DM models. Design/methodology/approach - The paper explains how the DM/BPR tool will extract and transfer the much-needed knowledge necessary for implementing the new business. Findings - The process of extracting knowledge hidden from large volumes of data (DM) has proved very successful in solving many business or scientific problems to achieve competitive advantage. As suggested in the DM/BPR framework, the DM model can be deployed on the massive data collected from past business processes of the organization which then yields the previously unknown knowledge and trends needed by top managers or decision makers in the organization for effective business process redesigning. Originality/value - The proposed DM/BPR framework transforms the old business into a new prospect-oriented business organization by carefully re-engineering the old system incorporating the new discovered knowledge which helps the manager to make wise and informed business decisions in the area of accountability, business change management expertise, business process analysis, business model design, business model implementation and others. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business process re-engineering; Data encapsulation; Knowledge management","Data handling; Database systems; Information management; Societies and institutions; Business process reengineering; Data encapsulation; Knowledge management; Data mining",,,,,,"Alter, S., (1999) Information Systems: A Management Perspective, , Addison-Wesley, Amsterdam; Ascari, A., Rock, M., Dutta, S., ""Re-engineering organisational change"" (1995) European Management Journal, 13 (1), pp. 1-30; Beriot, G., Vemadat, F., ""Enterprise modeling with CIMOSA: Functional and organizational aspects"" (2001) Production Planning and Control, 12 (2), pp. 128-136; Crowe, T.J., Fong, P.M., Bauman, T.A., Zayas-Castro, J.L., ""Quantitative risk level estimation of business process re-engineering efforts"" (2002) Business Process Management Journal, 8 (5), pp. 490-511; Gupta, A., McDaniel, J., ""Creating competitive advantage by effectively managing knowledge management"" (2002) Journal of Knowledge Management Practice, 3 (2), pp. 40-49; Hariharan, A., ""Knowledge management: A strategic tool"" (2002) Journal of Knowledge Management Practice, 3 (3), pp. 50-59; Jablonski, S., Bussler, C., (1996) Workflow Management: Modeling Concepts, Architecture and Implementation, , International Thompson Computer Press, London; Kotter, J., ""Leading change: Why transformation efforts fail"" (1995) Harvard Business Review, pp. 59-67. , March-April; Mena, J., (1999) Data Mining Your Website, , Digital Press, Boston MA; Robson, W., (1997) Strategic Management and Information Systems: An Integrated Approach, , 2nd ed., Financial Times Professional, London; Seidmann, A., Sundararajan, A., The effects of task and information asymmetry on business process redesign (1997) International Journal of Production Economics, 50 (213), pp. 117-128; Selma, L.M., Farhi, M., Hago, A.R., ""Case-based reasoning as a technique for knowledge management in business process redesign"" (2003) Electronic Journal of Knowledge Management, 1 (2), pp. 113-124; Smith, S., ""Rules of engagement"" (1996) Computer Weekly, pp. 36-37. , 14 March; Strassmann, P., (1995) The Politics of Information Management, , Information Economics Press, New Canaan, CT, available at: www.defenselink.mil/nii/bpr/bprcd/5135.htm; Wilg, K.M., ""Knowledge management: An introduction and perspective"" (1997) The Journal of Knowledge Management, 1 (1), pp. 6-14","Folorunso, O.; Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Ogun State, Nigeria",,,,,,,,09685227,,IMCSE,,"English","Inf Manage Comput Secur",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-24144499176

Design/methodology/approach - The paper first discusses the scale and frequency of the paralysis by analysis problem, before discussing it in more depth before addressing a fundamental problem, which is an important root of the paralysis by analysis problem, the indiscriminate usage of central tendency measures. Finally, it discusses how variance can be turned from being a liability into an asset. The approach is conversational but examples and a case study are provided to substantiate the arguments. Findings - The paper provides some recommendations for avoiding paralysis by analysis. Practical implications - Basically, the paper shows by argument and example why practitioners and some researchers need to better understand the limitations and promises of mathematical analyses and to some extent how to incorporate this understanding into their work. Originality/value - There is nothing really new in this paper, but it discusses a problem that for some reason is often ignored by practitioners and some researchers. The true value of the paper therefore lies in making practitioners, in particular, more aware of the limitations as well as the possibilities in the mathematical analyses performed in business analytics so that they can better understand what they are doing and hence get behind the numbers, as it were. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Analysis of variance; Business analysis; Mathematical analysis; Statistical methods of analysis",,,,,,,"Bernstein, P.L., (1996) Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk, p. 383. , John Wiley & Sons New York, NY; Chua, R.C.H., What you need to know about Six Sigma (2001) Productivity Digest, pp. 37-44; Davenport, T.H., Delong, D.W., Beers, M.D., Successful knowledge management projects (1998) Sloan Management Review, 39 (2), pp. 43-57; Defeo, J.A., An ROI story: The black belts of Six Sigma (2000) Training & Development, pp. 25-27; Signifying nothing?

The data mining system makes use of the decision tree algorithm and classification model in exploring the meaningful information, which is useful in the process of decision making. Subsequently, the rules discovered by the data mining system are expressed through the rule based knowledge presentation method of the expert system. The intelligent CIM system is applied to semiconductor packing factories and also point at the great fluctuation of DRAM (dynamic random access memory) prices. The results of this paper are the product yield, the manufacturing cycle time and the frequency of holding lot, which have been improved. The contribution can increase business competitiveness, reduce production cost, and promote the rate of available promise for order.","Computer integrated manufacturing (CIM); Data mining; Data warehouse","Algorithms; Competition; Cost effectiveness; Data mining; Data reduction; Decision making; Dynamic random access storage; Information analysis; Trees (mathematics); Data warehouse; Knowledge presentation; Online analytical processing (OLAP); Online transaction processing (OLTP); Computer integrated manufacturing",,,,,,"Berry, M.J.A., Linoff, G.S., (1999) Mastering Data Mining: The Art & Science of Customer Relationship Management, , John Wiley & Sons; Berry, M.J.A., Linoff, J.S., (1997) Data Mining Techniques: For Marketing, Sales, and Customer Support, , John Wiley & Sons; Berson, A., Smith, S., Thearling, K., (2000) Building Data Mining Applications for CRM, , McGraw-Hill; Chen, Z., (2001) Data Mining and Uncertain Reasoning: An Integrated Approach, , John Wiley & Sons; Drucker, P.P., Nonaka, I., Garvin, D.A., (1998) Harvard Business Review on Knowledge Management, , Harvard Business School Press; Groth, R., (2000) Data Mining: Building Competitive Advantage, , Prentice-Hall, Inc; Han, J., Kamber, M., (2001) Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques, , Morgan Kaufmann Publishers; Hung, S.-K., (2000) Data Mining in Fabrication, , Taipei, Taiwan: National Taiwan University of Science and Technology; Inmon, W.H., (2002) Building the Data Warehouse, , John Wiley & Son; Quinlan, J.R., (1993) C4.5: Programs for Machine Learning, , Morgan Kaufmann Publishers","Chen, R.-S.; Institute of Information Management, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan; email: rschen@iim.nctu.edu.tw",,,,,,,,02681900,,IJMTE,,"English","Int J Mater Prod Technol",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-9744283617

Therefore, it is hard to clarify the relationships among the indexes and to derive useful rules for production management. Existing approaches rely on following individual indexes without considering the production system as a whole. This study aims to fill the gap by reviewing the related studies on semiconductor manufacturing management and developing a complete set of performance indexes in hierarchy. In addition, we apply data mining techniques for analyzing production data collected in a semiconductor fab in Taiwan to validate this approach. The empirically derived patterns among the critical indexes were useful for supporting production management decisions. The results demonstrate the practical viability of this approach.

To complement the deficiency of the forecast flow in enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, we propose here a data searching architecture that can be built on the ERP system while meeting the individual needs of enterprises and providing real time accurate forecasts on changes in the future market. The present paper is based on the transaction flow processing power of ERP. It integrates the database and online analytical processing (OLAP) technologies, transaction and decision making flows of ERP, then uses data searching technology to integrate decision making and forecast flows. The data-searching engine is the actual design of a categorizing module. This research can finish within an hour the analyses and forecasts, which would take the traditional information technology system about three weeks to process the mock analyses. This makes decision making easier for entrepreneurs and thus enables them to handle well the always-changing market and establish themselves firmly. This research applies the ERP data searching system on the IC testing industry.

They struggle to find answers to: • Who can I consider a loyal customer? • What kind of marketing strategy is most likely to increase sales? • What can customer-purchasing patterns reveal about improving inventory control? • What is the most effective way to manage customer relations to increase revenues? (Rabinovitch, 1999). With the exponential growth in the amount of data being collected, improvements in technology, and research in machine learning, retailers are now able to reduce the ever growing difficult and complex decision making process by recruiting the efforts of data mining (Barry & Linoff, 1997). Data mining is a computerized technology that uses complicated algorithms to find relationships and trends in large data bases, real or perceived, previously unknown to the retailer, to promote decision support. Currently being utilized by such retail giants as Federated Department Stores, Nordstrom, and Wal-Mart, Inc., data mining is touted to be one of the greatest technologies to hit the retailing industry this decade (Rabinovitch, 1999). The purpose of this study is to critique data mining technology in comparison with more familiar analytical tools for strategic decision making by small to medium size retailers. The context for this study includes current and future industry applications and practices for research performed in data mining applications within the retail sector.","Data mining; Decision making; Marketing strategy; Retailers; Strategic planning; Technology",,,,,,,"Anderson, J.L., (2001) Profiles of Successful Graduate Students Using Artificial Neural Networking and Simultaneous Multiple Regression, , Unpublished Dissertation, Colorado State University; Arlitt, M., Krishnamurthy, D., Rolia, J., Characterizing the scalability of large web-based shopping systems (2001) ACM Transactions on Internet Technology, (1), 1, pp. 44-69. , August; Berkin, P., Beche, J.D., Randall, D.J., Interactive path analysis of web site traffic (2001) American Association for Artificial Intelligence, Proceedings, pp. 414-419; Berry, M.J.A., Linoff, G., (1997) Data Mining Techniques for Marketing, Sales and Customer Support, , New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc; Brijs, T., Swinnen, G., Vanhoof, K., Wets, G., Using association rules for product assortment decisions: A case study (1999) Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, p. 254; Brijs, T., Goethals, B., Swinnen, G., Vanhoof, K., Wets, G., A data mining framework for optimal product selection in a retail supermarket: The generalized PROFSET model (2000) Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, p. 300; Cabena, P., Hadjinian, P., Stadler, R., Verhees, J., Zanasi, A., (1998) Discovering Data Mining: from Concept to Implementation, , Upper Saddle River, N.J.: Prentice Hall; Data mining/CRM: Searching for an ROI (2001) Chain Store Age, pp. 24-26. , October; Data Mining: What Is Data Mining?, , http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty, no date.

Based on the data from 179 UK surveying firms, a data-driven path analysis is conducted to examine the direct and indirect effects of eight independent variables on business performance (the dependent variable). These are organization structure, environmental uncertainty, interconnectedness, size of firm, marketing performance, market orientation, management and strategy. The results suggest that only the marketing performance variable has a strong and significant direct effect on business performance. In turn, marketing performance is largely dependent on the firm's degree of market orientation. The finding in this study reinforces the postulation in existing literature that a market orientation is essential for sustaining competitive advantage in business firms.

Because of the complex fabrication processes and the cost resulted from defects, it is critical to identify possible faults through examining the failure patterns of wafer bin-maps. However, little research has been done to develop methods for clustering and classifying wafer bin-maps. We first used spatial statistics to examine the independence among failed dies and thus classified the bin maps into four categories: random failure pattern, systematic repulsion failure pattern, systematic attraction failure pattern, and others. For WBM with systematic attraction failure patterns, we developed an ART neural network for clustering to assist the product engineers in narrowing possible causes of manufacturing defects. We used empirical data from a fab for demonstration and the results showed the practical viability of this approach for its consistency and efficiency. This study concludes with discussions and remarks on future research.","Data mining; Decision analysis; Defect diagnosis; Neural network; Semiconductor manufacturing; Wafer bin-map","Defect diagnosis; Manufacturing defects; Semiconductor manufacturing; Wafer bin-map; Database systems; Decision theory; Industrial research; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Semiconductor device manufacture; Statistical methods; Data mining",,,,,,"Chinese sourceChinese sourceChinese sourceAgresti, A., (1990) Categorical Data Analysis, , John Wiley, New York; Baker, M.D., Himmel, C.D., May, G.S., Time series modeling of reactive ion etching using neural networks (1995) IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing, 8 (1), pp. 62-71; Chen, F.L., Liu, S.F., Chen, C.P., A neural-network approach to recognize defect spatial pattern in semiconductor fabrication (2000) IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing, 13 (3), pp. 366-373; Chien, C.F., Liu, Q.W., Developing data mining methods for wafer bin map clustering and the empirical study in a semiconductor manufacturing fab (2001) Proceedings of the International Conference on Modern Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management in New Century, pp. 581-587. , 10-12 August Tianjin, China; Collica, R.S., Card, J.P., Martin, W., SRAM bitmap shape recognition and sorting using neural network (1995) IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing, 8 (3), pp. 326-332; Friedman, D.J., Hansen, M.H., Nair, V.N., James, D.A., Model-free estimation of defect clustering in integrated circuit fabrication (1997) IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing, 10 (3), pp. 344-359; Freeman, J.A., Skapura, D.M., (1991) Neural Networks: Algorithm and Programming Techniques, , Addison-Wesley; Garpenter, G.A., Grossberg, S., ART2: Self-organization of stable category recognition codes for analog input patterns (1987) Applied Optics, 26 (23), pp. 4919-4930; Garpenter, G.A., Grossberg, S., The ART of adaptive pattern recognition by a self-organizing neural network (1987) Computer, 21 (3), pp. 77-88; Garpenter, G.A., Grossberg, S., ART3: Hierarchical search using chemical transmitters in seif-organizing pattern recognition architectures (1990) Neural Networks, 3, pp. 129-152; Garpenter, G.A., Grossberg, S., Rosen, D.B., Fuzzy ART: Fast stable learning and categorization of analog patterns by an adaptive resonance system (1991) Neural Networks, 4, pp. 759-771; Kaempf, U., The binomial test: A simple tool to identify process problems (1995) IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing, 8 (2), pp. 160-166; Mallory, C.L., Perloff, D.S., Hasan, T.F., Stanley, R.M., Spatial yield analysis in integrated circuit manufacturing (1983) Solid State Technology, (NOVEMBER), pp. 121-127; Mirza, A.I., Donoghue, G., Drake, A.W., Graves, S.C., Spatial yield modeling for semiconductor wafers (1995) IEEE/SEMI Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing Conference, pp. 276-281; Rao, V.B., Rao, H.V., (1995) C++ Neural Networks and Fuzzy Logic, , MIS Press, New York; Taam, W., Hamada, M., Detect spatial effects from factorial experiments: An application from integrated-circuit manufacturing (1993) Technometrics, 35 (2), pp. 149-160","Chien, C.-F.; Department of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management, National Tsing Hua University, 101, Kuang Fu Road, Hsinchu, 300, Taiwan; email: cfchien@mx.nthu.edu.tw",,,,,,,,10170669,,GOGOE,,"Chinese","J.

Because of automatic manufacturing and information integration technologies, an increasingly large amount of raw data has been accumulated from various sources automatically or semi-automatically from day to day. Mining potentially useful information from large such database becomes very important in both research and application. However, little research has been done on manufacturing data of high-tech industry. In particular, due to the complex fabrication processes and the high cost of defects, using data mining approach to diagnosing defects in semiconductor manufacturing is a critical issue.

The ability to collect and store all kinds of data has outpaced the capabilities of an individual to analyze, summarize, and extract ""knowledge"" from the data. Traditional methods of data analysis, based mainly on the analysts dealing directly with the data, are no longer the best alternative to be used. Although the database technology provided the basic tools for efficient storage and lookup for large data sets, the issues of how to enable engineers to understand large bodies of data remains a difficult problem. Recently, data mining approaches based on artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, machine learning, statistics, expert systems, and data visualization have created new intelligent tools for automated data mining and knowledge discovery. All these changes will have a profound impact on current practices used in manufacturing. The way that bills of materials are created, products are designed, and process plans are generated, will definitely be different with the availability of this new technology. In this paper the nature of these changes and their implications on product design and manufacturing are discussed and the basic issues regarding the design of Smart Data Mining Systems are examined with examples.","Data mining; Fuzzy logic; Manufacturing; Neural networks; Smart systems","Computer aided design; Computer aided manufacturing; Fuzzy sets; Internet; Knowledge acquisition; Neural networks; Planning; Product design; Bills of materials; Smart data mining systems; Data mining",,,,,,"URL:http://www.info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/HTTP2.html, Hypertext transfer protocolKahi, B., (1991) An Information System for Corporate Users, , WAIS.

However, the research related to the design and implementation of OLAP, particularly in the support of dispersed manufacturing networks in terms of 'intelligent decision making', has yet to be considered as remarkable. Research studies indicate that the level of intelligence of decision support systems can be enhanced with the incorporation of computational intelligence techniques such as case-based reasoning or rule-based reasoning. This paper describes the development of an intelligent data-mining system using a rule-based OLAP approach which can be adopted to support dispersed manufacturing networks in terms of performance enhancement. In this paper, the techniques, methods and infrastructure for the development of such a data-mining system, which possesses certain intelligent features, are presented. To validate the feasibility of this approach, a case example related to the testing of the approach in an emulated industrial environment is covered.","Data mining; Dispersed network manufacturing; Multidimensional database; OLAP; Rule-based reasoning",,,,,,,"Anon, N., OLAP on the web (1996) Datamation, 42 (7), p. 13; Berendt, B., Spiliopoulou, M., Analyis of navigation behaviour in web sites integrating multiple information systems (2000) VLDB Journal, 9, pp. 56-75; Datta, A., Thomas, H., The cube data model: A conceptual model and algebra for on-line analytical processing in data warehouses (1999) Decision Support Systems, 27 (3), pp. 289-301; Detlor, B., The corporate portal as information infrastructure: Towards a framework for portal design (2000) International Journal of Information Management, 20, pp. 91-101; Fayyad, U., Piatetsky-Shapiro, G., Smyth, P., KDD process for extracting useful knowledge from volumes of data (1996) Communications of the ACM, 39 (11), pp. 27-34; Flohr, U., OLAP by web (1997) BYTE, 22 (19), pp. 81-84; Gardingen, D., Watson, I., A web based CBR system for heating ventilation and air conditioning systems sales support (1999) Knowledge-Based Systems, 12 (5-6), pp. 207-214; Giarratano, J.C., (1998) CLIPS User's Guide, Version 6.10, , Athens, GA: Computer Software Manufacturing and Information Center, 5 August; Huang, Y.P., Huang, C.Y., Chen, S.S., Lin, W.C., The world wide web and the databases for retaining wall design (1999) Advances in Engineering Software, 30, pp. 799-808; Hui, S.C., Jha, G., Data mining for customer service support (2000) Information and Management, 38 (1), pp. 1-13; Inmon, W.H., Data warehouse and data mining (1996) Communications of the ACM, 39 (11), pp. 49-50; James, P., Peterson, T., (2000) Microsoft OLAP Unleashed, , Indianapolis, IN: Sams Publishing; Koutsoukis, N.S., Mitra, G., Lucas, C., Adapting online analytical process for decision modelling: The interaction of information and decision technologies (1999) Decision Support Systems, 26, pp. 1-30; Lau, H., Tso, S.K., Ho, J., Development of an intelligent task management system in a manufacturing information network (1998) Expert Systems with Applications, 15, pp. 165-179; Lee, W.B., Lau, H., Multi-agent modeling of dispersed manufacturing network (1999) Expert Systems with Applications, 16 (3), pp. 297-306; Noori, H., Lau, H., Wong, T.N., A generic framework for supporting internet services to achieve customer value creation (2000) Engineering with Computers, 16, pp. 53-62; Perkowitz, M., Etzioni, O., Towards adaptive web sites, conceptual framework and case study (2000) Artificial Intelligence, 118, pp. 245-275; Rezayat, M., The enterprise-web portal for life-cycle support (2000) Computer-Aided Design, 32, pp. 85-96; Sforna, M., Data mining in a power company customer database (2000) Electric Power Systems Research, 55 (3), pp. 201-209; Soukup, R., (1999) Inside Microsoft SQL Server 7.0, , Redmond, WA: Microsoft Press; Spertus, E., ParaSite: Mining structural information on the web (1997) Computer Networks and ISDN Systems, 29, pp. 1205-1215; Thomsen, E., Spofford, G., Chase, D., (1999) Microsoft OLAP Solutions, , New York: Wiley; Tso, S.K., Lau, H.C.W., Ip, R.W.L., Development of a fuzzy push delivery scheme for Internet sites (1999) Expert Systems, 16 (2), pp. 103-114; Viarengo, A., Burlando, B., Giordana, B.A., Gabrielids, G.P., Networking and expert-system analysis: Next frontier in biomonitoring (2000) Marine Environmental Research, 49, pp. 483-486","Lau, H.C.W.; Department of Manufacturing Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Hong Kong; email: mfhenry@inet.polyu.edu.hk",,,,,,,,02664720,,EXSYE,,"English","Expert Syst",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-19944378483

In this paper, the basic concepts of rough set theory and other aspects of data mining are introduced. The rough set theory offers a viable approach for extraction of decision rules from data sets. The extracted rules can be used for making predictions in the semiconductor industry and other applications. This contrasts other approaches such as regression analysis and neural networks where a single model is built. One of the goals of data mining is to extract meaningful knowledge. The power, generality, accuracy, and longevity of decision rules can be increased by the application of concepts from systems engineering and evolutionary computation introduced in this paper. A new rule-structuring algorithm is proposed. The concepts presented in the paper are illustrated with examples.","Data mining; Decision making; Evolutionary computation; Knowledge discovery; Knowledge structuring; Rough set theory; Semiconductor manufacturing","Knowledge structuring; Algorithms; Computational complexity; Data acquisition; Data reduction; Decision making; Information retrieval; Semiconductor device manufacture; Software agents; Data mining",,,,,,"Pawlak, Z., Rough sets (1982) Int.

In this paper, a novel approach for autonomous decision-making is developed based on the rough set theory of data mining. The approach has been tested on a medical data set for patients with lung abnormalities referred to as solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs).

It begins by defining TDM, and discussing the strategic management process in federal government organizations and the role of TDM as an integral part of this process. The paper then proceeds to describe some of the uses and applications of TDM. The results of a demonstration program by the US Office of Naval Research show some potential benefits from TDM: (1) integration of national and multi-national S and T databases; (2) supporting strategic decisions on the direction and funding of government S and T; and (3) creation of usable S and T databases to support strategic decisions in other areas of government. Implications of the demonstration program relative to larger scale implementation of TDM are discussed.

While previous work has focused on improving the efficiency of the mining algorithms, we consider how the representation, organization, and access of the data may significantly affect performance, especially when I/O costs are also considered. By a simple analysis and comparison of the counting stage for the Apriori association rules algorithm, we show that a 'column-wise' approach to data access is often more efficient than the standard row-wise approach. We also provide the results of empirical simulations to validate our analysis. The key idea in our approach is that counting in the Apriori algorithm with data accessed in a column-wise manner significantly reduces the number of disk accesses required to identify itemsets with a minimum support in the database - primarily by reducing the degree to which data and counters need to be repeatedly brought into memory.",,"Algorithms; Computer simulation; Data structures; Database systems; Data access; Data organization; Data mining",,,,,,,"Dunkel, Brian; Univ of Michigan, Ann Arbor, United States",,"IEEE","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Computer Society, Los Alamitos, CA, United States","Proceedings of the 1999 15th International Conference on Data Engineering, ICDE-99","23 March 1999 through 26 March 1999","Sydney, NSW, AUS",55096,,,PIDEE,,"English","Proc Int Conf Data Eng",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032671296

We study an approach in which once a few active recognizers tuned to significant orientation and spatial-frequency components of the reference spectrum are obtained, any input image to be compared with the reference one is passed through an operator designated to compare its excitation levels given by the active recognizers, to the corresponding excitation levels for the reference image. Hence, the distortion between a pair of complex images is measured as the weighted sum of the distortion in each filter of a bank of strongly responding recognizers, each tuned to a certain 2D spatial-frequency data in the reference picture, with the weighting of each filter modulating its amplitude response. © 1998 Pattern Recognition Society.

In order for a knowledge based system to control a manufacturing process, an important capability is that of prediction: forecasting the future trajectory of a process as well as the consequences of the control action. This paper presents a comparative study of explicit and implicit methods to predict nonlinear chaotic behavior. The evaluated models include statistical procedures as well as neural networks and case based reasoning. The concepts are crystallized through a case study in the prediction of chaotic processes adulterated by various patterns of noise. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.","Chaos; CIM; Data mining; Learning; Prediction","Artificial intelligence; Chaos theory; Information retrieval; Knowledge based systems; Learning systems; Mathematical models; Neural networks; Process control; Statistical methods; Technological forecasting; Case based reasoning; Data mining; Intelligent manufacturing systems; Computer integrated manufacturing",,,,,,"Egilmez, K., Kim, S.H., Deployment of robotic agents in uncertain environments: Game theoretic rules and simulation studies (1992) Artif.

However, before this potential can be realized, one needs to be able to relate the strategic objectives of a business to the use of the data mining technology. In this paper we focus on one aspect of that requirement, the translation of managerial goals into parameters of the algorithm being used to analyze the data. The first step in the process is to define a mapping from managerial goals to the performance measures of the algorithm. We then propose and apply an experimental approach using a classification algorithm, Probabilistic Inductive Learning, to develop a mapping between the performance measures and the parameters of the algorithm. The experimental results are analyzed and guidelines are given for setting the bias of the algorithm to meet managerial goals. We conclude by recommending that an experimental analysis similar to what we proposed be conducted for all data mining algorithms and provided along with documentation as an aid to the user. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.","Algorithm parameters; Business objectives; Data mining; Machine learning; Managerial decision making; Probabilistic inductive learning","Administrative data processing; Decision making; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Data mining algorithms; Probabilistic inductive learning; Decision support systems",,,,,,"Data Mining: Extending the Information Warehouse Framework, , http//www.almaden.ibm.com/cgi-bin/stss/get/data-mining; Fayyad, U., Piatetsky-Shapiro, G., Smyth, P., Knowledge discovery and data mining: Towards a unifying framework (1996) Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, , E.

The recognition module is part of the SPICOS system for the understanding of data base queries spoken in natural language. The recognition is based on statistical decision theory and thus amounts to an integrated approach that combines all available knowledge sources, such as inventory of subword units, pronunciation lexicon, and language model, and attempts to avoid local decisions during the process of acoustic recognition. The recognition decision amounts to a time-synchronous, left-to-right search through a large state space with delayed decisions. The recognized word sequence is then the best interpretation of the observed acoustic data within the constraints as given by the knowledge sources. The organization of the search can be viewed as an extension of the one-pass dynamic programming algorithm for connected word recognition. In continuous speech recognition, however, the search space is much larger, and an efficient organization of the search process is called for in order to keep the organization overhead as small as possible. In this paper, we present such an efficient search organization with the following characteristics. Its computational cost is proportional only to the number of hypotheses actually generated and is independent of the overall size of the potential search space. There is no limit to the number of word hypotheses, there is only a limit to the overall number of hypotheses due to storage constraints. The implementation of the search has been tested on a continuous speech data base comprising up to 4000 words for each of several speakers. In particular, the efficiency and robustness of the search organization has been checked and evaluated along many dimensions, such as different speakers, phoneme models, and language models. © 1992 IEEE",,"Acoustic Signal Processing; Database Systems - Query Languages; Decision Theory and Analysis; Mathematical Programming, Dynamic; Natural Language Processing Systems; Man Machine Dialog; Natural Language; Speech Recognizers; Voice Processing; Speech",,,,,,"Levinson, S.E., Structural methods in automatic speech recognition (1985) Proc.

As the number of tools continues to grow, such evaluation is necessary if simulation users are going to make sensible informed choices. This paper presents two specialized data-driven simulators developed to model Flexible Manufacturing Systems called RENSAM (Rensselaer Simulator for Automated Manufacturing) and RENVIS (Rensselaer Visual Interactive Simulator). Experience with these packages leads to consideration of the benefits of using such tools. Advantages include the ease with which models can be developed and the rapid pace of that development, and the enforcement of proper statistics collection; disadvantages include misplaced perception of how easy the tool is to use, weaknesses in implementation and the limitations of the simulator. It is shown that where a tool is deployed in the modelling process is of paramount importance, and guidance on deployment is provided. Other guidelines for developers and users of data-driven simulators are also developed. © 1991 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Computer Software; Flexible Manufacturing Systems--Scheduling; Industrial Plants--Automation; Automated Manufacturing; Data Driven Generic Simulators; FMS; Visual Interactive Simulator; Flexible Manufacturing Systems",,,,,,"Aniunelli, C.J., Volz, R.A., Mudge, T.N., Hierarchical decomposition and simulation of manufacturing cells using Ada (1986) Simulation, 46 (4), pp. 141-152; Bell, P.C., Visual interactive modelling in 1986 (1986) Recent Developments in Operational Research, pp. 1-12. , edited by V.
