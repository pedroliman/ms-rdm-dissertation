MORDM combines concepts and methods from many objective evolutionary optimization and robust decision making (RDM), along with extensive use of interactive visual analytics, to facilitate the management of complex environmental systems. Many objective evolutionary search is used to generate alternatives for complex planning problems, enabling the discovery of the key tradeoffs among planning objectives. RDM then determines the robustness of planning alternatives to deeply uncertain future conditions and facilitates decision makers' selection of promising candidate solutions. MORDM tests each solution under the ensemble of future extreme states of the world (SOW). Interactive visual analytics are used to explore whether solutions of interest are robust to a wide range of plausible future conditions (i.e., assessment of their Pareto satisficing behavior in alternative SOW). Scenario discovery methods that use statistical data mining algorithms are then used to identify what assumptions and system conditions strongly influence the cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and reliability of the robust alternatives. The framework is demonstrated using a case study that examines a single city's water supply in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) in Texas, USA. Results suggest that including robustness as a decision criterion can dramatically change the formulation of complex environmental management problems as well as the negotiated selection of candidate alternatives to implement. MORDM also allows decision makers to characterize the most important vulnerabilities for their systems, which should be the focus of ex post monitoring and identification of triggers for adaptive management. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Environmental management; Interactive visual analytics; Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms; Robust decision making; Uncertainty analysis; Water supply","Adaptive Management; Candidate solution; Complex environmental systems; Decision criterions; Decision makers; Evolutionary optimizations; Evolutionary search; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; Planning objectives; Planning problem; Rio Grande; Robust decisions; Satisficing; Statistical datas; System conditions; Texas , USA; Visual analytics; Data mining; Environmental management; Evolutionary algorithms; Uncertainty analysis; Visualization; Water supply; Decision making; adaptive management; algorithm; decision making; environmental change; environmental management; environmental modeling; multiobjective programming; visual analysis; vulnerability; water supply; Rio Grande Valley; Texas; United States","(1997) Water Marketing: the Next Generation.

We describe a new analytic method, based on robust decision making, for suggesting narrative scenarios that emerge naturally from a decision analytic framework. We identify key scenarios as those most important to the choices facing decision makers and find such cases with statistical analysis of datasets created by multiple runs of computer simulation models. The resulting scenarios can communicate quantitative judgments about uncertainty as well as support a well-defined decision process without many drawbacks of current approaches.

However, no systematic, general approach exists for finding robust strategies using the broad range of models and data often available to decision makers. This study demonstrates robust decision making (RDM), an analytic method that helps design robust strategies through an iterative process that first suggests candidate robust strategies, identifies clusters of future states of the world to which they are vulnerable, and then evaluates the trade-offs in hedging against these vulnerabilities. This approach can help decision makers design robust strategies while also systematically generating clusters of key futures interpretable as narrative scenarios. Our study demonstrates the approach by identifying robust, adaptive, near-term pollution-control strategies to help ensure economic growth and environmental quality throughout the 21st century. © 2006 INFORMS.","Adaptive planning; Decision making under uncertainty; Deep uncertainty; Robust decision making; Scenario planning","Adaptive planning; Analytic method; Decision making under uncertainty; Deep uncertainty; Robust decision making (RDM); Scenario planning; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Iterative methods; Pollution control; Sustainable development; Strategic planning","Azar, C., Holmberg, J., Karlsson, S., (2002) Decoupling-Past Trends and Prospects for the Future, , Report, Environmental Advisory Council, Ministry of the Environment, Stockholm, Sweden; Bankcs, S.C., Exploratory modeling for policy analysis (1993) Oper.
