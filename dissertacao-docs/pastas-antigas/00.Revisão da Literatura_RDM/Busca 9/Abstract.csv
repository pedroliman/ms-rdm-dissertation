In this article we present three historical approaches with the potential to remedy this deficiency. First, realist history can contribute to a better understanding of the historical embeddedness of strategic processes, and comparative historical analysis in particular can explicate the historical conditions, mechanisms, and causality in strategic processes. Second, interpretive history can add to our knowledge of the historical embeddedness of strategic practices, and microhistory can specifically help us understand the construction and enactment of these practices in historical contexts. Third, poststructuralist history can elucidate the historical embeddedness of strategic discourses, and genealogy in particular can increase our understanding of the evolution and transformation of strategic discourses and their power effects. Thus, this article demonstrates how, in their specific ways, historical approaches and methods can add to our understanding of different forms and variations of strategic processes and practices, the historical construction of organizational strategies, and historically constituted strategic agency. © 2016 Academy of Management Review."

There are no risk-free energy sources in terms of security of supply or environmental impacts. However, more efficient methods are more environmentalist or eco-friendly systems. In parallel with the recent high rates of economic growth in Turkey, the annual increase in consumption growth rate reached an average of 5.59% in the last 11 years. Between 2004 and 2014, electricity consumption increased from 150 billion kWh – 1.70 times – to 255.5 billion kWh. Among the electrical energy installed capacity of Turkey, production obtained from hydraulic sources was 35%, natural gas 30.1%, coal 20.5%, and geothermal + wind + solar sources 6.4%. The share of other sources was 8%. In 2014, with 250.4 billion kWh electric generation, Turkey was ranked 19th globally. It’s global share was 1.1%. Turkey’s energy sector, which has been based upon on three fundamental pillars (natural gas, coal, and hydraulic) so far, is now being reorganized as a five-pillared structure, including renewable energy sources and nuclear energy. This study discusses the energy overview and new strategic developments to demonstrate Turkey’s recent energy policies on the international arena. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

However, the topic is still complex and lacks synthesis. Toward that end, the purpose of this paper is to investigate how collaboration is addressed in the public administration and nonprofit sector journals, and applies well-established strategic decision-making theories to shed light on possible research directions that would provide rigor to the field of collaboration. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conduct a literature review of the top nonprofit and public administration journals, believing these most likely to contain articles on the topic of multi-sector collaboration. Findings: The authors identify a number of themes, including need for clarity, temporality, call to collaborate, funding, partnering issues and processes, benefits of collaboration across three different collaborative types. Originality/value: The authors embed well-known strategic decision-making theories into the themes emergent from this review and offer suggestions as to how future researchers may test strategic decision-making processes within multi-sector collaborations. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

This burden disproportionately affects low and middle-income countries, which are least equipped to provide orthopaedic care. We aimed to assess orthopaedic capacity in Ghana, describe spatial access to orthopaedic care, and identify hospitals that would most improve access to care if their capacity was improved. Methods: Seventeen perioperative and orthopaedic trauma care-related items were selected from the World Health Organization's Guidelines for Essential Trauma Care. Direct inspection and structured interviews with hospital staff were used to assess resource availability and factors contributing to deficiencies at 40 purposively sampled facilities. Costdistance analyses described population-level spatial access to orthopaedic trauma care. Facilities for targeted capability improvement were identified through location-allocation modeling. Results: Orthopaedic trauma care assessment demonstrated marked deficiencies. Some deficient resources were low cost (e.g., spinal immobilization, closed reduction capabilities, and prosthetics for amputees). Resource nonavailability resulted from several contributing factors (e.g., absence of equipment, technology breakage, lack of training). Implants were commonly prohibitively expensive. Building basic orthopaedic care capacity at 15 hospitals without such capacity would improve spatial access to basic care from 74.9% to 83.0% of the population (uncertainty interval [UI] of 81.2% to 83.6%), providing access for an additional 2,169,714 Ghanaians. Conclusions: The availability of several low-cost resources could be better supplied by improvements in organization and training for orthopaedic trauma care. There is a critical need to advocate and provide funding for orthopaedic resources. These initiatives might be particularly effective if aimed at hospitals that could provide care to a large proportion of the population. © 2016 BY THE JOURNAL OF BONE AND JOINT SURGERY, INCORPORATED."

It looks at the governance mechanisms in place at the level of the metropolitan areas and tries to assess if the cities and the neighboring communities are equal partners in these cooperation schemes. The paper also looks at one of the most important functions of these metropolitan areas - strategic planning in the form of drafting the integrated plans for urban development (IPUDs). We look at this function also from the perspective of the relations between the cities and their hinterlands. The paper has the following structure: section two briefly examines the concept of growth poles and their creation in Romania; section three looks at strategic planning as a tool for the implementation of the growth pole policy; section four presents the methodology of the study; section five details the main findings of the research, while section six briefly presents the recommendations and the conclusions. The empirical research for the study consisted in interviews with public servants working for the communities that are part of the metropolitan areas formed around the growth poles. As for the conclusions, the authors wish to emphasize that metropolitan areas should be understood in the broader context of the territorial reform. © NISPAcee 2015."

In this framework, energy system sustainability represents one of the major challenge the EU is facing and its implementation passes through a path of coordinate actions carried out by local governments in which objectives of sustainable development become integral part of strategic programming. The aim of this research is to provide local administrations with an analytical support tool to guide key strategic decisions in energy and climate planning on the medium-long term, assessing the possible role of local energy systems in the achievement of sustainable objectives at national/European scale.

The city is getting water supply from seven sources located in three watersheds, namely, Nauti, Ashwani and Giri watershed. Nauti and Ashwani watersheds have fully been tapped but Giri watershed is partly tapped. Presently, only 20 MLD (million litres per day) of water is being drawn from Giri River which is about 37% of the present water demand. Resource assessment in Giri watershed was accomplished using Remote Sensing Techniques and GIS based Arc-SWAT Hydrological Model. Study has established that average annual precipitation in the Giri watershed for 26 years (1984-2010) is about 1011.44 mm, out of which about 32% flows as runoff, 12% as groundwater and about 56% as evapotranspiration. The monthly inflow varies from 0.37 to 18.93 m3/s and 75% annual dependable discharge is 2.80 m3/s at the existing Headworks. Being ungauged watershed there are no statistical data for validation of results. However considering Water Balance Equation as the validation criteria, coefficient of correlation ""R"" between observed Rainfall and simulated Runoff was found to be 0.94 which validates the output. Results were further validated through actual measurement of inflow in lean period, which surprisingly has shown very good correlation (R = 0.95) between simulated and observed stream flow. Model output further reveals that the excess inflow can be utilized to fulfill additional water demand of 42.61 MLD (2031) for Shimla city by creating storage of about 1.12 MCM (million cubic metres).

This study presents the process and outcomes of IT strategic planning undertaken at a pediatric hospital (PH) in Canada. Methods: A five-stage sequential and incremental process was adopted. Various tools / approaches were used including review of existing documentation, internal survey (n = 111), fifteen interviews, and twelve workshops. Results: IT strategic planning was informed by 230 individuals (12 percent of hospital community) and revealed consistency in the themes and concerns raised by participants (e.g., slow IT projects delivery rate, lack of understanding of IT priorities, strained communication with IT staff). Mobile and remote access to patients' information, and an integrated EMR were identified as top priorities. The methodology and used approach revealed effective, improved internal relationships, and ensured commitment to the final IT strategic plan. Several lessons were learned including: maintaining a dynamic approach capable of adapting to the fast technology evolution; involving stakeholders and ensuring continuous communication; using effective research tools to support strategic planning; and grounding the process and final product in existing models. Conclusions: This study contributes to the development of best practices in IT strategic planning, and illustrates how to apply the theoretical principles in this area. This is especially important as IT leaders are encouraged to integrate evidence-based management into their decision making and practices. The methodology and lessons learned may inform practitioners in other hospitals planning to engage in IT strategic planning in the future. © Cambridge University Press 2014."

However, the problem with strategic planning is that it isn't always very effective. The reasons for this range from the fact that sometimes it is not strategic enough, or robust enough, to the use of strategies developed to meet the needs of very different industries.

The incoming Coalition Government followed through on this. This article looks at the implications of RSS abolition and the consequences, looking in particular at its implication for economic growth and investment in more prosperous, southern England."

Although there is agreement that there should be greater coordination of initiatives and resources, there is little guidance in the literature to address the method to achieve the necessary transformation. Traditional approaches to strategic planning often engage a few leaders and produce a set of immeasurable initiatives. A nontraditional approach, consisting of a Whole-Scale (Dannemiller Tyson Associates, Ann Arbor, MI) engagement, appreciative inquiry, and a balanced scorecard can, more rapidly transform an academic health center. Using this nontraditional approach to strategic planning, increased organizational awareness was achieved in a single academic health center. Strategic planning can be an effective tool to achieve alignment, enhance accountability, and a first step in meeting the demands of the new landscape of healthcare."

In this highly swarming context towards process intensification, this article provides an overview of the different strategies which are reported in the literature to perform syngas or H 2 purification and conditioning into the gasifier. A promising avenue towards process intensification consists in integrating several functionalities into suitable fluidized bed gasifiers, such as catalytic tar cracking/reforming, CO 2 elimination, H 2 separation and the elimination of particles and other contaminants. The development of new catalytic integrated gasification concepts is also proposed to achieve high conversion performances while pursuing significant process intensification. This strategy is illustrated by relevant examples such as the design of short contact time partial oxidation catalytic reactors, the implementation of specific reaction media such as supercritical water or molten metal, or the realisation of a close contact between solid catalysts and lignocellulosic biomass. Most of these different technologies are not mature yet and research effort has to be performed for optimizing each of these approaches, calling for a multidisciplinary and multi-scale approach integrating catalysis, chemistry, reaction and process engineering. The design of new advanced gasification reactor concept still has to be pursued in order to achieve the challenging one-step production of a high quality syngas from biomass gasification. The implementation of such innovative biomass gasification breakthrough concepts could be one of the most promising ways of process intensification resulting in a significant cut down of the production costs of synthesis gas and H 2 derived from biomass.

The document aims to propose guidelines for a strategic re-planning of the Brazilian ceramic tiles sector, making the Brazilian producers aware of the national market fragility (in spite of its recent remarkable evolution) and helping the policy makers to reflect on the need of reviewing the strategic planning methods and practice, of designing new targeted programs (based on coherence between operation and business strategies), of providing improved management to strengthen the sector against unfair competition by low-cost producers, enhancing the necessary infrastructure in technology, work, marketing and quality management. The analysis is limited to the single-firing production technology. The wide-coverage strategic analysis of the Brazilian ceramic tiles sector, very little studied until now in a scientific way, emphasizes the importance of applying research methodology and may be valuable to both scholars and practitioners. Additionally, it highlights the need of investments in innovation (product design and production technology) and the fundamental role of the sector organization, identifying different dimensions. It is possible to conclude that the recent Brazilian production growth is not due to a natural strengthening because of the hit of the sector and of correct enterprises strategy, but it seems the result of a temporary and favorable economic contingency."

I argue that these changes affected the justices' voting patterns in systematic ways. My assertion is that the end of appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council removes a constraint on Supreme Court decision-making, which had led to strategic voting by the justices in the period during which the JCPC could examine and reverse the Supreme Court's decisions. For the Charter of Rights, I assert that its existence as a legal document served as a constraint for conservative justices on the Court in the period immediately following its passage. Drawing on the universe of decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada from 1945 to 2005 in criminal, tax, and tort cases, I use Baum's (1988, 1989) method of examining policy change on the Supreme Court over time. I examine judicial votes before and after the Supreme Court becomes a court of last resort in 1949, and before and after passage of the Charter of Rights in 1982. Then, I employ a logistic regression model in the Charter of Rights period and a comparison of Supreme Court of Canada and JCPC voting in the 1949 period. I find support for the assertion that justices will vote strategically when faced with threat of reversal. The Charter of Rights also appears to have a constraining effect. Its mandate as a progressive document appears to have a constraining effect on conservative justices' voting patterns, at least in the short-term following its passage. © 2012 ACSUS."

Additionally, individual performance of treatment stages and changes in sewage flows and loads have to be considered to achieve an optimised outcome. Typically, large scale capital projects are required to address the many challenges that face a WWTP. However, significant cost savings can be made if smaller optimisation projects are pursued to maximise the capacity of existing infrastructure and therefore defer high cost capital upgrades. To achieve this end, SA Water started a formal process to review the capacity of each process element of the Bolivar WWTP and found several opportunities to optimise current process performance. Based on these outcomes a future strategy document was developed that enables the next major plant upgrade to be deferred by 8-10 years. This paper summarises SA Water's approach to develop such a documentation to allow a strategic asset management, optimise its capital expenditure and achieve significant cost savings. It also highlights some of the projects that were identified during this process to improve the current treatment plant performance. © IWA Publishing 2012."

Accounting for human population movement (HPM) in planning for control, elimination and post-elimination surveillance is important, as evidenced by previous elimination attempts that were undermined by the reintroduction of malaria through HPM. Strategic control and elimination planning, therefore, requires quantitative information on HPM patterns and the translation of these into parasite dispersion. HPM patterns and the risk of malaria vary substantially across spatial and temporal scales, demographic and socioeconomic sub-groups, and motivation for travel, so multiple data sets are likely required for quantification of movement. While existing studies based on mobile phone call record data combined with malaria transmission maps have begun to address withincountry HPM patterns, other aspects remain poorly quantified despite their importance in accurately gauging malaria movement patterns and building control and detection strategies, such as cross-border HPM, demographic and socioeconomic stratification of HPM patterns, forms of transport, personal malaria protection and other factors that modify malaria risk. A wealth of data exist to aid filling these gaps, which, when combined with spatial data on transport infrastructure, traffic and malaria transmission, can answer relevant questions to guide strategic planning. This review aims to (i) discuss relevant types of HPM across spatial and temporal scales, (ii) document where datasets exist to quantify HPM, (iii) highlight where data gaps remain and (iv) briefly put forward methods for integrating these datasets in a Geographic Information System (GIS) framework for analysing and modelling human population and Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection movements. © 2012 Pindolia et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

For this article, strategic plans for 13 coalitions were analyzed both before and after a root cause analysis approach was applied to determine the coalitions' strategic plans potential impact and comprehensiveness. After root cause analysis, strategic plans trended toward targeting policies and practices rather than on single agency programmatic changes.

Prior to 1982, Kenneth Andrews, Igor Ansoff, and Michael Porter gave strong emphasis to strategic planning and positioning choices by firms in industries to achieve better performance. The chief executive officer, top management team, and strategic planners were the most influential actors within firms in the strategy process through the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. However, with the OPEC I and OPEC II oil shocks adversely impacting economic activity in industrialised countries in the 1970s and early 1980s, the expected planningperformance relationship for organisations was increasingly questioned. Circumstances required that firms become more agile and adaptive to economic and market challenges in the 1980s. This created an opportunity in 1982 for the contribution of McKinsey and Co consultants including Tom Peters, Robert Waterman, and Kenichi Ohmae to start to focus attention in the strategy discipline on organisations developing fast, flexible strategic thinking practice. This has had implications for the role of top managers in strategy process. This paper uses mixed methods to explore this outcome and report key findings on the modern role of top managers in the strategy process."

With increasing water demand and scarcity, utilities require effective strategies for optimum use of available water resources. Diverse water loss reduction options exist. Deciding on which option to choose amidst conflicting multiple criteria and different interests of stakeholders is a challenging task. In this paper, an integrated multi-criteria decision-aiding framework for strategic planning of water loss management is presented. The PROMETHEE II method was applied within the framework in prioritizing water loss reduction options for Kampala city. A strategic plan that combines selective mains and service lines replacement and pressure management as priorities is the best compromise based on preferences of the decision makers and seven evaluation criteria characterized by financial-economic, environmental, public health, technical and social impacts. The results show that the most preferred options are those that enhance water supply reliability, public health and water conservation measures. This study demonstrates how decision theory coupled with operational research techniques could be applied in practice to solve complex water management and planning problems. © 2011 The Author(s)."

Design/methodology/approach: The article presents a case study of Indra, a leading Spanish technology company, showing how it has integrated corporate social responsibility within its strategic objectives. Findings: What can you do to get and keep that competitive edge? One firm thinks it has found the answer by incorporating ethical behavior and corporate social responsibility (CSR) into every aspect of its activities. It seems that a corporate culture focused on ethical behavior can improve your standing and reputation inside and outside the company, so that employees, shareholders and communities at large see the organization as ready to do the right thing, rather than motivated exclusively by making money. Practical implications: The article explains how basing competitive advantage on ethics and social responsibility can benefit stakeholders and improve long-term profitability in a technology-driven company. It shows how embedding ethical considerations and CSR as a basic aspect of strategy development and communicating this approach to stakeholders affects employee motivation and behavior, together with company reputation.

The agricultural sector is so extensive that achievement of national goals and high levels of development is practically unattainable without active participation by farmers. Provision of a combination of agricultural functional requirements by cooperatives would lead to enhancement of the standard of living of their members. Rural production cooperatives, also known as agricultural cooperatives, are defined as a modern construct with their own specific organization and management. Cooperatives incorporate their own ruling principles, structures, networks, rules, regulations, and bylaws. These features provide concrete benefits in the process of agricultural development. This paper aims to review the activities of rural agricultural production cooperatives in Iran and propose a strategic planning approach for development and institutionalization of their operations. This qualitative research was conducted in Iran using case study and purposeful sampling method. The proposed strategies for promotion of production cooperatives include: provision of support in terms of financial credits, organizational and management expertise, technical know-how and technology, equipment and training, empowerment of members aimed at transforming them into successful farm managers, promotion of team work among members, and extraction of appropriate information and practical advice from research data provided by contemporary investigations. In conclusion, it is proposed that establishment of cooperatives alongside other issues should be considered by policy makers and local leaders and representatives trusted by farmers be involved in their implementation. © 2011 Academic Journals."

Additionally, no study has examined the operational effects of these decisions in-depth. The purpose of this paper is to fill these two gaps in the academic literature. Design/methodology/approach: A literature review confirms the existence of these gaps and informs hypotheses based on the three theories. Additionally, the model for continuous decision making on outsourcing is used to systematically collect data from five cases studies. The cases - all make-to-order or engineering-to-order - have been analysed on effects for operational performance and control resulting from strategic decision making on outsourcing. Findings: From this evaluation, it appears that these companies perform weakly on the control of the outsourced activities. Furthermore, it seems that the (manufacturing) strategy is disconnected from outsourcing practices and that outsourcing hardly contributes to competitive advantage. Moreover, from some of the case studies it appears that the decision for strategic outsourcing is irreversible. Finally, traditional criteria and behaviour during decision making prevail, i.e. a cost-driven perspective, which does not address contemporary challenges. Research limitations/implications: Despite being explorative and based on only five cases, these findings indicate that strategic decision making on outsourcing based on the three theories insufficiently accounts for operational issues that emerge later during manufacturing; it might be necessary to revise the theoretical base for outsourcing to include management of outsourced manufacturing activities. Practical implications: The findings imply also that managers in companies, in any case those firms that operate on the basis of make-to-order or engineering-to-order, should be less ""rushed"" into strategic decision making on outsourcing that has adverse effects. Rather, outsourcing requires integral decision making in contrast to factual decision making that displayed signs of bounded rationality (particularly expressed through the focus on cost savings). Social implications: The dominant, one-sided view of the cost perspectives contributes to the notion that the shareholders' interests for short-term profitability conflict with long-term organisational health (apparent through the impact on operational management of outsourcing activities). Originality/value: Stakeholders involved in strategic decision making might use this research to evaluate fundamentally decisions that cover outsourcing. At the same time, for consultants and practitioners it offers insight that is complementary to the often one-sided strategic decision making with its focus on cost reductions. Furthermore, this paper demonstrates the limited validity of current theories that underpin strategic decision making on outsourcing and provides an impetus for academics to develop more appropriate theory. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Design/methodology/approach: The paper outlines a case study example of the use of the QFD methodology. It looks at how well it was able to achieve its objectives. Findings: Meeting customer expectations and creating customer satisfaction has become the Holy Grail for companies wishing to improve their competitiveness and profitability. Success, however, for many companies remains illusive. Their ability to align and integrate customer satisfaction with their overall strategic direction has proved to be more difficult that they thought. Their repeated desire to put the customer first is severely hampered by the lack of effective methodologies and tools to support the creation of an integrated process. Companies need a mechanism for aligning important concepts - a tool that will outline the important steps that they need to implement in order to successfully identify business priorities.

For this purpose, the paperoutlines the method of Strategic Planning and Management of Productive Systems for Improving Competitiveness (GESis), developed from the review of nine methodological proposals for strategic planning. In that sense, the GESis method facilitates the implementation of vertical organization capable of implementing the strategies and shaping an associativeculture.

Public utility service providers have often been seen as lacking the capacity to identify and/ or implement the needed transformation processes. Instead, privatization has been proposed as a panacea to remedy this deficit. However, privatization projects are often not realized because they encounter strong political opposition. This article presents the results of strategic planning projects in three public wastewater organizations in Switzerland. This study suggests that if appropriate processes are implemented, public utility organizations are able to overcome their limitations in identifying the relevant capability deficits and select adequate strategies to compensate for the deficits. While these strategies may deviate substantially across utilities due to differences in the goals pursued, the widespread adoption of strategic planning methods by public utilities represents a viable alternative to privatization."

We approach this problem from a neurocognitive perspective. We see profound incompatibilities between the cognitive process - deductive reasoning - channeled into the collective mind of strategists within the formal planning process through its tools of strategic analysis (i.e., rational technologies) and the essentially inductive reasoning process actually needed to address ill-defined, complex strategic situations. Thus, strategic analysis protocols that may appear to be and, indeed, are entirely rational and logical are not interpretable as such at the neuronal substrate level where thinking takes place. The analytical structure (or propositional representation) of these tools results in a mental dead end, the phenomenon known in cognitive psychology as functional fixedness. The difficulty lies with the inability of the brain to make out meaningful (i.e., strategy-provoking) stimuli from the mental images (or depictive representations) generated by strategic analysis tools. We propose decreasing dependence on these tools and conducting further research employing brain imaging technology to explore complex data handling protocols with richer mental representation and greater potential for strategy creation. © 2007 New York Academy of Sciences."

This perspective holds great promise for development of an understanding on how strategy discourse and subjectivity are intertwined. We wish to add to this existing research by outlining a discursive struggle approach to subjectivity. To understand the complex subjectification and empowering/disempowering effects of organizational strategy discourse, this approach focuses on organization-specific discourse mobilizations and various ways of resistance. Drawing on an analysis of the discourses and practices of 'strategic development' in an engineering and consulting group we provide an empirical illustration of such struggles over subjectivity. In particular, we report three examples of competing ways of making sense of and giving sense to strategic development, with specific subjectification tendencies. First, we show how corporate management can mobilize and appropriate a specific kind of strategy discourse to attempt to gain control of the organization, which tends to reproduce managerial hegemony, but also trigger discursive and other forms of resistance. Second, we illustrate how middle managers resist this hegemony by initiating a strategy discourse of their own to create room for manoeuvre in controversial situations. Third, we show how project engineers can distance themselves from management-initiated strategy discourses to maintain a viable identity despite all kinds of pressures. Although our examples are case-specific, we believe that similar discursive dynamics also characterize strategizing in other organizations.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: United States. Participants: Nationwide random sample of 1,250 owners/managers of independent community pharmacies. Intervention: Mailed survey. Main Outcome Measures: Comprehensiveness of strategic planning conducted; components used in the strategic planning process. Attitudes and perceptions of owners/managers of independent community pharmacies toward strategic planning. Results: A total of 527 (42.1%) usable questionnaires were returned. Of the 141 (26.8%) respondents who indicated that they conduct strategic planning, most components of the process were used. However, only 78 (55.3%) of those respondents conducted a review of pharmacy systems, and only 60 (42.6%) periodically evaluated implemented strategies. Approximately 88% of the variance in comprehensiveness was accounted for by 12 variables identified as significantly associated with the comprehensiveness of strategic planning conducted by owners/managers of independent community pharmacies. These included factors such as favorable cost-benefit relationship, impact of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, and remaining competitive in the pharmacy marketplace. Conclusion: While a minority of the survey population, respondents who reported conducting strategic planning used a reasonably comprehensive process. Further, several variables were identified as significant factors associated with comprehensiveness of strategic planning conducted."

Design/methodology/ approach - General conclusions are drawn and strategic imperatives inferred from a review of the relevant literature and a set of case histories based on personal interviews with key executives in the Chinese operations of six large overseas consumer-goods companies. Findings - The undoubted strategic significance of guanxi has been diluted recently among joint ventures designated as ""encouraged"" by the Chinese government, and is being replaced by a market-driven paradigm of marketing operations. The guanxi-driven paradigm remains a crucial factor in planning and managing effective working relationships when the Chinese partner is one officially classified as ""restricted"". Case histories show that early success is no guarantee of continuing dominance, as indigenous competition intensifies and Chinese corporations become larger and better resourced. Research limitations/implications - Foreign multinational entrants to the Chinese market must remain sensitive to characteristically Chinese business and consumer behaviour, but can successfully adopt a more Western approach to marketing strategy in certain situations. It is essential to use marketing intelligence effectively, and to plan well beyond the short term.

Design/methodology/approach - Based on a postal questionnaire primary data was collected from 113 UK companies. A series of multivariate analyses were undertaken to test the hypothesized relationships. Findings - While hypotheses explaining the formality of a company's planning process were well accounted for, no relationship between formal planning process and subjective company performance was observed. Research limitations/implications - Measurement validity may be a problem. The data are cross-sectional, therefore causal linkages among the variables cannot be firmly established. Related to this point is the fact that firm performance is a function of prior, not current, planning and other management practices. Longitudinal data would be needed in order to prove that causal relationships exist and control for time lag effects. Originality/value - Despite the continued importance of performance objectives in the prescriptive literature, recent attention has not been given to strategic planning and performance in empirical research. One function of this paper is to re-kindle this area of research. More specifically, the empirical study reported in this paper draws on data from UK companies, which is novel in this stream of research. In a review of 29 relevant studies by Greenley (1994) the only study identified reporting UK data was that of Grinyer and Norburn (1975), the majority of the remaining studies reporting data from the USA. Greenley notes that while this represents a stream of research from a single business culture, the major issue is one of relevance to the practice of strategic planning in Europe and other countries. Although the principles of strategic planning should, of course, have universal application, there may be national differences in strategic planning, country dependent influences from business culture, and influences from different national trading conditions. The strategic management field can be criticized for not examining particular phenomena in non-US contexts, with respect to the impact of FSP and organizational performance this study attempts to rectify this imbalance. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

In spite of recent constructive changes for better in this sphere, methodical provision of strategic decisions evaluation is a field that lacks attention. The basic component of the suggested method for strategic decisions evaluation is a system of three levels of criteria uniting the following partial integrated criteria of compatibility, economic-financial, competitive and organizational culture criteria. The formation of these criteria is based on primary criteria paying attention to relative weight of each separate criterion. Paying attention to the diversity of exact combinations of business subjects and a broad wide of business conditions, the following controlled parameters are included into this system of criteria: The list of primary criteria, the weight of primary and partial criteria and the borders of quality assessment intervals. These controlled parameters are the most important preconditions for adaptable possibilities of the suggested method. Taking into account psychological aspects of decision making the evaluation of implementation risks of strategic decisions is given in another block. Strategic decisions are ranked according to the results of a complex integrated criterion and are presented for person making decisions accompanied by risk evaluations while implementing them. The following advantages are peculiar to the suggested method of strategic decisions evaluation: versatile and complex evaluation; alternative decisions are compared according to quantitative indicators which increase objectivity; less non productive evaluation expenditure; evaluation becomes transparent and clear to business subjects."

There is a need for planning but this planning must be strategic in nature, focusing on the most important issues and allowing for the many uncertainties that are inherent in the current situation. The paper describes the field testing of a strategic planning process in India and subsequent efforts to explore ways of institutionalising the lessons learnt from this experience. It reveals some of the key problems encountered during these activities, in particular the lack of a planning culture among local stakeholders and the consequent tendency to respond to problems in ad hoc ways. Analysis of workshops and training courses suggests that there is a need to develop a more integrated approach to capacity building, with a strong emphasis on the way in which individual activities fit into overall planning and development processes. International development agencies could do more to encourage such an integrated approach to capacity building, planning and implementation. In doing so, they should recognise that, in the absence of a strong planning culture, informed decision making is often constrained by a lack of information. Where this is the case, it is critically important to extend the preparation stage of the project cycle to enable local stakeholders time gather the information required to develop a full understanding of problems and possibilities. © IWA Publishing 2005."

There seems to be no theory of strategy logic, i. e. the general process and management characteristics generating a certain strategy outcome. Strategy content research has presented a systematic analysis on the basis of competitive advantage, and strategy process research has provided careful in-depth descriptions and examinations of strategy making. However, the basic strategy logic, including the underlying procedures, activities and reasoning that generate a particular type of strategy, has been less commonly evaluated. In particular, principles and details of strategy making in complex situations seem less clear. The two most influential lines of research in strategic management in the last two decades, of the industrial-organization (IO) perspective on strategy (e.g. Porter, 1980, 1981) and the resource-based view (RBV) (e.g. Barney, 1986, 1991) have compellingly established that strategy grows out of exploiting industry and resource structures, respectively. However, these strategy content views do not appear to consider how industry and resource configurations are actually developed in terms of underlying logic. The process by which market imperfections in the form of entry barriers (Porter, 1980, 1981) and isolating mechanisms (Rumelt, 1984) in fact arise has not been determined. Implicitly, centrally located managers seem to play an important role in analyzing and planning competitive and resource positions, but the principles and mechanisms that form these strategic positions essentially remain unclear (Cockburn, Henderson, & Stern, 2000). The fundamental logic that generates a certain strategic outcome and, in the end, competitive advantage is not identified. Strategy-process views, in contrast, (e.g. Bower & Doz, 1979; Burgelman, 1983; Doz & Prahalad, 1987; Mintzberg, 1978; Johnson, 1987; Pettigrew, 1977; Quinn, 1980) have provided rich and systematic descriptions showing that strategy making involves a variety of contextual influences and actors in addition to analytical exercises and leadership by managers at the center. However, our understanding of the particulars of these alternative strategy processes still appears to be imperfect. A whole range of contextual influences (political, cognitive, cultural, symbolic, etc.) have been identified (e.g. Johnson, 1987; Pettigrew, 1985; Porac & Thomas, 1990), but it is not entirely clear how they influence and shape strategy outcome. In brief, it is unclear how different procedures, activities and reasoning generate certain strategy content. Hence, the fundamental strategy logic is likewise rather indeterminate in strategy process views as well as in strategy content approaches. While characteristics regarding strategy (planning) procedures have been described for rather well-defined strategic issues, the basic logic in strategy is particularly unclear in situations that are complex - i. e. where resources and industries are less defined, and markets and products are unclear. In fact, it seems as if one common way of avoiding an examination of a basis or logic in strategy is to assume the existence of a strategy and its central artifacts and contexts from the start. The role for research then becomes one of explaining the characteristics of competitive advantage (strategy content) or describing the general process of its development and/or implementation (strategy process) ex post. However, the procedures, activities and reasoning generating and creating competitive advantage and strategy are rarely addressed (Regnér, 1999). Another approach that avoids the question of strategy logic is to present strategy as an art; this approach is common both in more planning-oriented writings (Christensen, Andrews, Bower, Hamermesh, & Porter, 1982) and in more process-oriented literature (Mintzberg, 1975). This approach run the risk of precluding critical examinations of the actual mechanisms and procedures involved by placing reliance on intuition and feelings, which are highly difficult to examine. Perhaps not surprisingly, research has often responded with this tactic since managers themselves often refer to ""gut feelings"" and undefined circumstantial events in explaining why a particular strategy outcome finally presented itself. Art is certainly an important part of the answer, especially in situations of uncertainty (Szulanski & Amin, 2000), but by reducing strategy under more complicated circumstances exclusively to artistic talent or questions of chance, we risk overlooking important aspects of strategy making and, furthermore, denying managers relevant and systematic knowledge that might be useful in practice. It might be argued that strategy is in fact most relevant precisely in complex circumstances, where research evaluations of strategy logic seem most vague (Schoemaker, 1990; Regnér, 2001). When optimization is possible the strategic complexity is low, the question of strategy is actually of little interest, at least for generating long run above-average returns. Finally, the revelation of the strategy logic or principles that underlie different strategy processes, would seem crucial for understanding not only how strategy outcome and content are actually generated, but also what type of capabilities that are important in developing competitive advantage (Teece, Pisano, & Shuen, 1997). This paper seeks to identify fundamental principles in strategy - the general process and management characteristics involved in diverse types of strategy making, including the underlying procedures, activities and reasoning - and how they generate different strategy outcomes. It distinguishes between two types of strategy process or strategy logics and addresses the question how they influence strategy. Based on the prior work in economics, cybernetics and organizational change and learning, it proposes a dynamic view of strategy processes as involving two fundamentally different types of strategy logic depending on external context and internal location. Besides discussing the relationship to the prior strategy process research, the paper suggests possible links to new theoretical developments in strategic management such as the dynamic capabilities view (Teece et al., 1997) and related evolutionary and learning views (Winter, 2000; Zollo & Winter, 2002), and the activity-based view (Johnson, Melin, & Whittington, 2003). It ends with a discussion of interactions between the two logics. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Our central argument is that organisations can learn from the development of strategic planning in the 1970s and 1980s. We identify three weaknesses - a bureaucratic and formalised approach, lack of implementation and lack of integration throughout the organisation - which were prevalent in strategic planning in the past and which are potentially just as problematic for an integrated corporate governance approach to business ethics. We suggest ways these weaknesses might be avoided and provide questions for boards of directors to consider when integrating ethical concerns into their organisations' corporate governance structures. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005."

This article investigates comparative strategic decision styles in Britain, the USA, Germany and Japan. An industry at an advanced stage in terms of globalization, vehicle components manufacture, was selected in order to explore the extent of convergence and whether this has changed. Between 1989 and 1998, field case studies were made of 100 strategic investment decisions (SIDs) by manufacturers in these four countries. Longitudinal judgements were supplemented by earlier comparative strategy field research carried out in 60 suppliers between 1980 and 1983, and two longitudinal case studies, one from the UK and one from Japan, interviewed throughout both these periods and again in 2002. Two competing hypotheses, derived from rich research literatures, are investigated. The first (H1) suggests that national institutional and cultural factors exert profound differences, and should therefore be afforded more significance as globalization proceeds further. The second (H2) is apparently contradictory and emphasizes that institutions and organizations are likely to respond to convergence pressures, spurred by global capital markets and competition on the one hand, and a diffusion of 'professional management' practices on the other. Japanese firms generally, and German family firms in particular, were still found to exhibit deep-rooted differences from the Anglo-Saxon model, which appears to confirm H1. However study of German public companies reveals that their strategic approaches are far less divergent from what is now an increasingly consistent Anglo-Saxon model than they were a decade ago, which appears to confirm the competing hypothesis H2. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005."

This paper applies established qualitative research methods to the online environment to evaluate how web managers generate and incorporate web metrics to inform strategic marketing decisions. Design/methodology/approach - Initial theories were developed using a comprehensive literature review as well as exploratory interviews with New Zealand companies. Applying a mixed methodology, the exploratory research used interviews to assess current practice within the industry, refine the research questions and set up the research design. An in-depth case study in the USA evaluated best practices and highlighted issues that affect the use of web metrics. The main data collection utilized case studies to generate the in-depth information necessary for theory building. Findings - The exploratory results showed that companies currently measure web site performance and consumer behaviour online but are still uncertain how best to use those metrics to inform strategic marketing decisions. The in-depth case study showed how web metrics can be used when sufficient resources are available and measuring performance is a priority. Owing to the initially recognized low level of web metrics use, the main research was expanded purposively to selected participants who make greater use of web metrics. Originality/value - This paper applies traditional qualitative research methods to the online environment. Analysis of the case studies and continued research will address the research gap and provide recommendations to web managers as well as attempt to illustrate best practices, solutions to issues and industry benchmarks. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

However, the increasing complexity of organizations' internal and external environments and the unstructured nature of decisions at the strategic level make the decision making a very complicated task. The number of influential variables is so large and their effects are so varied that any attempt to encapsulate them in a rational manner can indeed hinder the decision making process. To this end, this research explores the advantages of decision support tools and the benefit these tools can yield for the strategic management. Some of these tools are deterministic and structured: they rely on straightforward calculation or optimisation techniques. The solution to the unstructured problems, however, has relied on heuristic approaches and judgement of the decision-maker. While deterministic problems have to a large extent been addressed and appropriate models and algorithm have been developed for them, the unstructured problems have remained relatively unattended and the research works in this area tend to focus on single issues. This paper conceptualizes an umbrella framework using a ""Viable Systems Diagnosis "" VSD Model and a ""Decision Framework"", within which strategic decision making research applicable to construction can be coordinated and developed, thus avoiding wasteful duplication and gaps in knowledge. To this end, the research highlights the relevance and potential use of artificial intelligent techniques in assisting the managers with unstructured decisions. Further, it is argued that a strategic decision support system should assume an integrated structure, as many decision nodes, within the overall decision making structure, share common attributes and the inter-connection amongst these decision nodes has a complex structure. Therefore, the object oriented approach will provide an efficient structure for the development of the overall framework."

Indeed, recent surveys and business press articles indicate broad support for the use of intuition when making strategic decisions. The need for quick decisions, the need to cope with demands created by complex market forces, and the assumed benefits of applying deeply held knowledge combine to create strong perceived value for the intuitive approach. Intuition, however, has not been subjected to sufficient review, particularly in a forum for executives and other managers. This article responds to the need for critical evaluation. Utilizing holistic hunch and automated expertise as two fundamental definitions, our review evaluates intuition's costs and benefits in light of an organization's goals. Drawing evidence from the fields of behavioral decision making, strategic decision making, and mental modeling, our conclusions suggest intuition is a troublesome decision tool. To contribute to effective managerial practice, we offer tactics that decision makers can use to make intuitive judgments and choices less troublesome."

Improvement calls for insight into what brings about failure and ways to avoid it. The article shows that failed decisions stem from decision-maker actions in which blunders create traps and traps bring about failure. Blunders arise when decision-makers rush to judgment, use failure-prone practices, and allocate time and money unwisely. Here we consider how these blunders set a trap that limits the search for remedies. Three approaches are offered for expanding the search for alternatives and avoiding the limited-search trap. First, decision-makers should expand the arena of action by identifying key stakeholders, their concerns and claims. The second approach is to increase the clarity of objectives and select one that defines an arena of action with the broadest possible scope. The third is to use multiple perspectives to uncover options that would otherwise be undiscovered. Successful decision-makers add innovative options to the mix of remedies to be considered. Shell's attempts to dispose of an obsolete oilrig. Quaker's purchase of Snapple, and Columbus, Ohio's seeking of tax support for a sports arena illustrate how the three blunders can limit the alternatives search and discourage innovation.

The study has been done from the perspective of the community as a whole and has been undertaken in two phases reflecting the different objectives of Australian state surveys in terms of the exploration industry and government policy-making. This paper reports on the second part of this valuation process, measuring the impact of upgraded survey data on government mineral policy decision processes. The valuation methodology developed is a comparative approach used to determine net benefit foregone by not upgrading information infrastructure. The underlying premise for the geological survey study is that existing and upgraded data sets will have a different probability that a deposit will be detected. The approach used in the valuation of geoscientific data introduces a significant technical component with the requirement to model both favorability of mineral occurrence and probability of deposit occurrence for two different generations of government data. The estimation of mineral potential uses modern quantitative methods, including the U.S. Geological Survey three-part resource-assessment process and computer-based prospectivity modeling. To test the methodology mineral potential was assessed for porphyry copper type deposits in part of the Yarrol Province, central Queensland. Results of the Yarrol case study supports the strategy of the state surveys to facilitate effective exploration by improving accuracy and acquiring new data, as part of resource management. It was determined in the Yarrol Province case study that in going from existing to upgraded data sets the area that would be considered permissible for the occurrence of porphyry type deposits almost doubled. The implication of this result is that large tracts of potentially mineralized land would not be identified using existing data. Results of the prospectivity modeling showed a marked increase in the number of exploration targets and in target rankings using the upgraded data set. A significant reduction in discovery risk also is associated with the upgraded data set, a conclusion supported by the fact that known mines with surface exposure are not identified in prospectivity modeling using the existing data sets. These results highlight the absence in the existing data sets of information critical for the identification of prospective ground. Quantitative resource assessment and computer-based prospectivity modeling are seen as complementary processes that provide the support for the increasingly sophisticated needs of Australian survey clients. Significant additional gains to the current value of geoscientific data can be achieved through the in-house analysis and characterization of individual data sets, the integration and interpretation of data sets, and the incorporation of information on geological uncertainty. © 2001 International Association for Mathematical Geology."

Strategic planning is criticized for stifling creative responses to the new marketplace and for fostering compartmentalized organizations, adherence to outmoded strategies, tunnel vision in strategy formulation, and overemphasis on planning to the detriment of implementation. However, effective strategic planning can be a force for mobilizing all the constituents of an organization, creating discipline in pursuit of a goal, broadening an organization's perspective, improving communication among disciplines, and motivating the organization's workforce. It is worthwhile for healthcare organizations to preserve these benefits of strategic planning, at the same time recognizing the many sources of turbulence and uncertainty in the healthcare environment.

This is seen as complementary to other innovations relating to management and policy issues. Advanced mining technology should most sensibly be achieved through evolutionary change, whereby new enabling technologies are integrated with conventional mining technology. Four key components of evolutionary change are considered in detail: incremental advances in conventional mining technology; creation of the digital mine and intelligent mining through information technology; automation of conventional mining practices; and development of distance mining. The case is also made, however, to counteract the current trend away from more revolutionary R&D, to anticipate longer term needs which will warrant more radical change in methods and equipment."

However, rather than focusing on previously examined individual differences, this study examined differences in the decision-making processes used by entrepreneurs and managers in large organizations. Building on nonrational decision-making models from behavioral decision theory, we asserted that entrepreneurs are more susceptible to the use decision-making biases and heuristics than are managers in large organizations. To understand why entrepreneurs and managers in large organizations may vary in the extent to which they manifest biases and heuristics in their decision-making, it is important to understand the utility of nonrational decision-making. Under conditions of environmental uncertainty and complexity, biases and heuristics can be an effective and efficient guide to decision-making. In such settings, more comprehensive and cautious decision-making is not possible, and biases and heuristics may provide an effective way to approximate the appropriate decisions. The use of heuristics has also been found to be associated with innovativeness. Perhaps a critical difference between these sets of individuals is the extent to which they manifest biases and heuristics in their decision-making. We examined differences between entrepreneurs and managers in large organizations with respect to two biases and heuristics: overconfidence (overestimating the probability of being right) and representativeness (the tendency to overgeneralize from a few characteristics or observations). In this study, entrepreneurs are those who have founded their own firms and are currently involved in the start-up process with the average time since founding of 1.7 years. The analysis for this study involved responses from 124 entrepreneurs. Managers are individuals with middle to upper level responsibilities with substantial oversight in large organizations. To be included in this study, the managers had to oversee at least two functional areas (sample average was 4.55 functional areas). Usable responses were received from 95 managers. The results from the logistic regression analysis show strong support for both hypotheses. Even after controlling for numerous factors, such as several traits and demographic factors, enduring support was found for the way entrepreneurs and managers in large organizations make decisions. Our overconfidence and representativeness variables correctly categorized entrepreneurs and managers more than 70% of the time. Thus, this research indicates that entrepreneurs do behave differently than do managers in large organizations and that these differences are substantial. Practically, we speculate that without the use of biases and heuristics, many entrepreneurial decisions would never be made. With entrepreneurial ventures in particular, the window of opportunity would often be gone by the time all the necessary information became available for more rational decision-making. Additionally, successfully starting a new business usually involves overcoming multiple hurdles. Using biases and heuristics as simplifying mechanisms for dealing with these multiple problems may be crucial. To face such hurdles from a strict econometric approach would not only postpone decisions, but would in all likelihood make them overwhelming. More specifically, overconfidence may be particularly beneficial in implementing a specific decision and persuading others to be enthusiastic about it as well. The use of biases and heuristics may also offer some help in explaining why entrepreneurs sometimes make bad managers. Whereas the use of cognitive biases may be beneficial in some circumstances, it can lead to major errors in others. Although research has yet to establish performance implications, it is possible that the more extensive use of heuristics in strategic decision-making may be a great advantage during the start-up years. However, it may also lead to the demise of a business as a firm matures. © 1997 Elsevier Science Inc."

To thrive in this changing marketplace, wound clinic practitioners must understand the background of managed care and its terms, and be familiar with the concepts of capitation and incentives. Part of managed care's impact upon the specialty of wound care is that practitioners must define outcomes, healing rates and standards of care. Patient referral will depend on the cost effective delivery of care from all specialists in addition to the primary care physician. To meet these needs the authors created a hospital based wound care clinic with multiple interrelated areas of influence and have gathered statistical data. Managed care is here to stay and wound care practitioners must learn how to prepare for it and deal with it effectively."

The authors present an approach that can help AHCs visualize possible new configurations of their traditional services of research, education, and clinical care. This approach is based on successful strategic management methods from the private sector and involves a three-dimensional 'topography of services' encompassing all possible configurations of AHCs' services. From among the many possible configurations, the authors discuss three in detail. The historic one, which they call the traditional model, is characteristic of AHCs that give high priority to biomedical and clinical 'research, have broad medical education activities, and deliver comprehensive, high-quality clinical care. In the future, this configuration will be rare, and two others are likely to predominate. First is the 'revised' traditional model, which would offer 'boutique' clinical services, biomedical research, and medical education for MD-PhD students, residents, and fellows seeking tertiary care or academic careers. The patient care required for undergraduate medical education and clinical research would be provided by partnerships with community-based providers. Second is the academic services model, which would focus on competitive primary and secondary clinical services, health services and operations research, and primary care medical education. The authors discuss the implications of these models for AHCs' organizational structures and faculty incentives. They conclude that the clarity with which AHCs' strategic decisions are made and communicated to faculties and the incentive systems that are selected to motivate faculty and to provide the selected services may ultimately determine which institutions survive."

Managers often focus exclusively on adapting the organization to circumstances in its environment. This approach overlooks opportunities for fostering environmental changes that will be favorable for the organization. Such changes often can be achieved through political action. Political action is an extension of the process of maximizing opportunities and averting threats. It requires the additional work of policy analysis and stakeholder assessment followed by developing and implementing a political strategy. The strategy must consider the possibilities for effective intervention at one or more of the five stages of the policy process. The choices also must take into account the positions of other stakeholders and the costs and benefits that the organization anticipates from each of the four strategic approaches: indirect action, collaboration, negotiation, and contest."

A methodology for conducting scenario analysis using the Jefferson County Department of Health and the national, State, and county issues confronting it is outlined. Key health care and organizational issues were identified using published sources, focus groups, questionnaires, and personal interviews. The most important of these issues were selected by asking health department managers to evaluate the issues according to their probability of occurrence and likely impact on the health department. The high-probability, high-impact issues formed the basis for developing scenario logics that constitute the story line holding the scenario together. The results were a set of plausible scenarios that aided in strategic planning, encouraged strategic thinking among managers, eliminated or reduced surprise about environmental changes, and improved managerial discussion and communication."

Due in part to the use of forms of problem-solving that are incongruent with tribal values and cultural patterns, many Indian communities have been paralyzed in their efforts to develop consensus on strategic plans. While many tribes have experimented with various forms of conflict management techniques, careful consideration must be given to the appropriateness of the approach employed Because the cultural traditions of Indian communities are rooted in a consensual approach to problem-solving, dispute resolution approaches imposed by non-Indian law and bureaucracies often conflict with tribal values.
