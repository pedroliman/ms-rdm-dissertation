In this article we present three historical approaches with the potential to remedy this deficiency. First, realist history can contribute to a better understanding of the historical embeddedness of strategic processes, and comparative historical analysis in particular can explicate the historical conditions, mechanisms, and causality in strategic processes. Second, interpretive history can add to our knowledge of the historical embeddedness of strategic practices, and microhistory can specifically help us understand the construction and enactment of these practices in historical contexts. Third, poststructuralist history can elucidate the historical embeddedness of strategic discourses, and genealogy in particular can increase our understanding of the evolution and transformation of strategic discourses and their power effects. Thus, this article demonstrates how, in their specific ways, historical approaches and methods can add to our understanding of different forms and variations of strategic processes and practices, the historical construction of organizational strategies, and historically constituted strategic agency. © 2016 Academy of Management Review.",,,"Abrahamson, E., Managerial fads and fashions: The diffusion and rejection of innovations (1991) Academy of Management Review, 16, pp. 586-612; Abrahamson, E., Management fashion (1996) Academy of Management Review, 2, pp. 254-285; Allard-Poési, F., A Foucauldian perspective on strategic practice: Strategy as the art of (un)folding (2015) Cambridge Handbook of Strategy As Practice (2nd Ed.), pp. 234-248. , In D.

There are no risk-free energy sources in terms of security of supply or environmental impacts. However, more efficient methods are more environmentalist or eco-friendly systems. In parallel with the recent high rates of economic growth in Turkey, the annual increase in consumption growth rate reached an average of 5.59% in the last 11 years. Between 2004 and 2014, electricity consumption increased from 150 billion kWh – 1.70 times – to 255.5 billion kWh. Among the electrical energy installed capacity of Turkey, production obtained from hydraulic sources was 35%, natural gas 30.1%, coal 20.5%, and geothermal + wind + solar sources 6.4%. The share of other sources was 8%. In 2014, with 250.4 billion kWh electric generation, Turkey was ranked 19th globally. It’s global share was 1.1%. Turkey’s energy sector, which has been based upon on three fundamental pillars (natural gas, coal, and hydraulic) so far, is now being reorganized as a five-pillared structure, including renewable energy sources and nuclear energy. This study discusses the energy overview and new strategic developments to demonstrate Turkey’s recent energy policies on the international arena. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","energy policy; Energy sources; strategic development; Turkey","Economics; Energy policy; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Free energy; Natural gas; Renewable energy resources; Electric generation; Electricity-consumption; Energy source; International arena; Pillared structures; Renewable energy source; Strategic development; Turkey; Geothermal energy","Benli, H., Potential of renewable energy in electrical energy production and sustainable energy development of Turkey: Performance and policies (2013) Renewable Energy, 50, pp. 33-46; Delibalta, M.S., Uluslararası Madencilik Kongresi ve Sergisi, TMMOB Maden Mühendisleri Odası Yayını, Ankara (Türkiye) (2011) Sürdürülebilir Kalkınmada AB-Türkiye Enerji ve Çevre Politikalarının Rolü, 22, pp. 3-10; Ergün, S., ve Özkara, Y., Anahtar (2012) Enerji ve Verimlilik, pp. 16-19. , Sayı: 277, Ankara; (2010) Temiz Enerji, Enerji ve Tabi Kaynaklar Bakanlığı (ETKB), , http://www.enerji.gov.tr/tr-TR/Sayfalar/Temiz-Enerji; Enerji ve Tabi Kaynaklar Bakanlığı (ETKB) Strateji Geliştirme Başkanlığı (2015) Dünya ve Ülkemiz Enerji ve Tabii Kaynaklar Görünümü, , Sayı: 9, 102 s, Temmuz, Ankara:; Kaygusuz, K., Energy policy and climate change in Turkey, Energy Convers (2003) Manage, 44. , 1671–1688; Kiliç, F.Ç., Kaya, D., Energy production, consumption, policies, and recent developments in Turkey (2007) Renewable Sustainable Energy Rev, 11, pp. 1312-1320; Maden, M.O., TMMOB Maden Mühendisleri Odası Enerji Çalışma Gurubu (MadenMO) (2015) Enerji ve Kömür Raporu, p. 128 s. , Ankara:; Soyhan, H.S., Sustainable energy production and consumption in Turkey: A review (2009) Renewable Sustainable Energy Rev, 13, pp. 1350-1360; Yıldız, T., Enerji ve Tabi Kaynaklar Bakanlığı Strateji Geliştirme Başkanlığı (2014) 2015 Yılı Bütçe Sunumu, p. 125s. , Kasım, Ankara:; Yılmaz, A.O., Uslu, T., Energy policies of Turkey during the period 1923–2003 (2007) Energy Policy, 35, pp. 258-264; Yuksel, I., Energy production and sustainable energy policies in Turkey (2010) Renewable Energy, 35, pp. 1469-1476; Yuksel, I., Kaygusuz, K., Renewable energy sources for clean and sustainable energy policies in Turkey (2011) Renewable Sustainable Energy Rev, 15, pp. 4132-4144; Yuksel, I., Water management for sustainable and clean energy in Turkey (2015) Energy Rep, 1, pp. 129-133","Delibalta, M.S.; Department of Mining Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Nigde UniversityTurkey; email: msdelibalta@nigde.edu.tr",,"Taylor and Francis Inc.",15567249,,,,"English","Energy Sources Econ.

However, the topic is still complex and lacks synthesis. Toward that end, the purpose of this paper is to investigate how collaboration is addressed in the public administration and nonprofit sector journals, and applies well-established strategic decision-making theories to shed light on possible research directions that would provide rigor to the field of collaboration. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conduct a literature review of the top nonprofit and public administration journals, believing these most likely to contain articles on the topic of multi-sector collaboration. Findings: The authors identify a number of themes, including need for clarity, temporality, call to collaborate, funding, partnering issues and processes, benefits of collaboration across three different collaborative types. Originality/value: The authors embed well-known strategic decision-making theories into the themes emergent from this review and offer suggestions as to how future researchers may test strategic decision-making processes within multi-sector collaborations. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Decision making; Network analysis",,"Andriopoulos, C., Determinants of organisational creativity: a literature review (2001) Management Decision, 39 (10), pp. 834-841; Arends-Kuenning, M., Makundi, F., Agricultural biotechnology for developing countries prospects and policies (2000) American Behavioral Scientist, 44 (3), pp. 318-349; Babiak, K., Thibault, L., Challenges in multiple cross-sector partnerships (2009) Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly, 38 (1), pp. 117-143; Babiak, K.M., Criteria of effectiveness in multiple cross-sectoral interorganizational relationships (2009) Evaluation and Program Planning, 32 (1), pp. 1-12; Baer, W.S., Competition and collaboration in online distance learning (2000) Information, Communication & Society, 3 (4), pp. 457-473; Balassiano, K., Chandler, S.M., The emerging role of nonprofit associations in advocacy and public policy: trends, issues, and prospects (2010) Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly, 39 (5), pp. 946-955; Barnes, J.E., Fisher, S.G., A recipe for success: the blending of two disparate nonprofit cultures into a successful collaboration – a case study (2007) Journal of Foodservice Business Research, 9 (2-3), pp. 111-125; Berger, I., Cunningham, P., Drumwright, M., Social alliances: company/nonprofit collaboration (2004) California Management Review, 47 (1), pp. 58-90; Berman, E.M., West, J.P., Public-private leadership and the role of nonprofit organizations in local government: the case of social services (1995) Review of Policy Research, 14 (1D2), pp. 235-251; Bidet, E., Overcoming labor market problems and providing social services: government and civil society collaboration in South Korea (2012) Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly, 41 (6), pp. 1215-1230; Boris, E.T., An interview with Sara E.

We aimed to assess orthopaedic capacity in Ghana, describe spatial access to orthopaedic care, and identify hospitals that would most improve access to care if their capacity was improved. Methods: Seventeen perioperative and orthopaedic trauma care-related items were selected from the World Health Organization's Guidelines for Essential Trauma Care. Direct inspection and structured interviews with hospital staff were used to assess resource availability and factors contributing to deficiencies at 40 purposively sampled facilities. Costdistance analyses described population-level spatial access to orthopaedic trauma care. Facilities for targeted capability improvement were identified through location-allocation modeling. Results: Orthopaedic trauma care assessment demonstrated marked deficiencies. Some deficient resources were low cost (e.g., spinal immobilization, closed reduction capabilities, and prosthetics for amputees). Resource nonavailability resulted from several contributing factors (e.g., absence of equipment, technology breakage, lack of training). Implants were commonly prohibitively expensive. Building basic orthopaedic care capacity at 15 hospitals without such capacity would improve spatial access to basic care from 74.9% to 83.0% of the population (uncertainty interval [UI] of 81.2% to 83.6%), providing access for an additional 2,169,714 Ghanaians. Conclusions: The availability of several low-cost resources could be better supplied by improvements in organization and training for orthopaedic trauma care. There is a critical need to advocate and provide funding for orthopaedic resources. These initiatives might be particularly effective if aimed at hospitals that could provide care to a large proportion of the population. © 2016 BY THE JOURNAL OF BONE AND JOINT SURGERY, INCORPORATED.",,"capacity building;

It looks at the governance mechanisms in place at the level of the metropolitan areas and tries to assess if the cities and the neighboring communities are equal partners in these cooperation schemes. The paper also looks at one of the most important functions of these metropolitan areas - strategic planning in the form of drafting the integrated plans for urban development (IPUDs). We look at this function also from the perspective of the relations between the cities and their hinterlands. The paper has the following structure: section two briefly examines the concept of growth poles and their creation in Romania; section three looks at strategic planning as a tool for the implementation of the growth pole policy; section four presents the methodology of the study; section five details the main findings of the research, while section six briefly presents the recommendations and the conclusions. The empirical research for the study consisted in interviews with public servants working for the communities that are part of the metropolitan areas formed around the growth poles. As for the conclusions, the authors wish to emphasize that metropolitan areas should be understood in the broader context of the territorial reform. © NISPAcee 2015.","associations for intercommunity development; cooperation; growth poles; integrated plans for urban development; metropolitan areas; strategic planning",,"Benedek, J., (2004) Amenajarea Teritoriului Şi Dezvoltarea Regionalə [Territorial Planning and Regional Development], , Cluj: Presa Universitarə Clujeanə; Boudeville, J.R., (1966) Problems of Regional Economic Planning, , Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press; Bryson, J.M., (1995) Strategic Planning for Public and Nonprofit Organisations: A Guide to Strenghthening and Sustaining Organisational Achivements, , San Francisco: Jossey Bass; Christofakis, M., Papadaskalopoulos, A., The growth poles strategy in regional planning: The recent experience of greece (2011) Th Eoretical and Empirical Research in Urban Management, 6 (2), pp. 5-20; Constantin, D.L., (2000) Introducere în Teoria Şi Practica Dezvoltərii Regionale [Introduction to the Theory and Practice of Regional Development], , Bucureşti: Editura Economicə; Dranca, D., Cluj-napoca metropolitan zone.

The city is getting water supply from seven sources located in three watersheds, namely, Nauti, Ashwani and Giri watershed. Nauti and Ashwani watersheds have fully been tapped but Giri watershed is partly tapped. Presently, only 20 MLD (million litres per day) of water is being drawn from Giri River which is about 37% of the present water demand. Resource assessment in Giri watershed was accomplished using Remote Sensing Techniques and GIS based Arc-SWAT Hydrological Model. Study has established that average annual precipitation in the Giri watershed for 26 years (1984-2010) is about 1011.44 mm, out of which about 32% flows as runoff, 12% as groundwater and about 56% as evapotranspiration. The monthly inflow varies from 0.37 to 18.93 m3/s and 75% annual dependable discharge is 2.80 m3/s at the existing Headworks. Being ungauged watershed there are no statistical data for validation of results. However considering Water Balance Equation as the validation criteria, coefficient of correlation ""R"" between observed Rainfall and simulated Runoff was found to be 0.94 which validates the output. Results were further validated through actual measurement of inflow in lean period, which surprisingly has shown very good correlation (R = 0.95) between simulated and observed stream flow. Model output further reveals that the excess inflow can be utilized to fulfill additional water demand of 42.61 MLD (2031) for Shimla city by creating storage of about 1.12 MCM (million cubic metres).

This study presents the process and outcomes of IT strategic planning undertaken at a pediatric hospital (PH) in Canada. Methods: A five-stage sequential and incremental process was adopted. Various tools / approaches were used including review of existing documentation, internal survey (n = 111), fifteen interviews, and twelve workshops. Results: IT strategic planning was informed by 230 individuals (12 percent of hospital community) and revealed consistency in the themes and concerns raised by participants (e.g., slow IT projects delivery rate, lack of understanding of IT priorities, strained communication with IT staff). Mobile and remote access to patients' information, and an integrated EMR were identified as top priorities. The methodology and used approach revealed effective, improved internal relationships, and ensured commitment to the final IT strategic plan. Several lessons were learned including: maintaining a dynamic approach capable of adapting to the fast technology evolution; involving stakeholders and ensuring continuous communication; using effective research tools to support strategic planning; and grounding the process and final product in existing models. Conclusions: This study contributes to the development of best practices in IT strategic planning, and illustrates how to apply the theoretical principles in this area. This is especially important as IT leaders are encouraged to integrate evidence-based management into their decision making and practices. The methodology and lessons learned may inform practitioners in other hospitals planning to engage in IT strategic planning in the future. © Cambridge University Press 2014.","Evidence-based management; Health information technology; Hospitals; IT strategic planning; Technology assessment","Decision making; Hospitals; Dynamic approaches; Evidence-based managements; Health information technologies; Incremental process; Internal relationships; Limited information; Technology assessments; Technology evolution; Strategic planning; Canada; electronic medical record; health care personnel; hospital; human; interview; medical documentation; medical informatics; patient information; pediatric hospital; Review; strategic planning; workshop; access to information; documentation; electronic health record; hospital; hospital information system; organization; organization and management; questionnaire; Access to Information; Canada; Documentation; Electronic Health Records; Hospital Information Systems; Hospitals, Pediatric; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Organizational Innovation; Organizational Objectives; Planning Techniques; Surveys and Questionnaires","(2011) EHR 2015: Advancing Canada's Next Generation of Healthcare, , https://www2.infoway-inforoute.ca/Documents/Vision_2015_Advancing_Canadas_next_generation_of_healthcare%5B1%5D.pdf, Canada Health Infoway. accessed May; Karpf, M., Lofgren, R., Bricker, T., Defining the role of university of kentucky healthcare in its medical market -how strategic planning creates the intersection of good public policy and good business practices (2009) Acad Med, 84, pp. 161-169; Wurster, C.J., Lichtenstein, B.B., Hogeboom, T., Strategic, political, and cultural aspects of it implementation: Improving the efficacy of an it system in a large hospital (2009) J Healthc Manag, 54, pp. 191-207; Jaana, M., Tamim, H., Paré, G., Key it management issues in hospitals: Results of a delphi study in canada (2011) Int J Med Inform, 80, pp. 828-840; Glaser, J.P., (2002) The Strategic Application of Information Technology in Health Care Organizations, , 2nd ed.

Design/methodology/approach: This briefing is prepared by an independent writer who adds their own impartial comments and places the articles in context. Findings: It would be very difficult to find a company CEO or a department manager who did not acknowledge the need for strategic planning when making major decisions about company policies or when contemplating large-scale directional change. However, the problem with strategic planning is that it isn't always very effective. The reasons for this range from the fact that sometimes it is not strategic enough, or robust enough, to the use of strategies developed to meet the needs of very different industries. Practical implications: The paper provides strategic insights and practical thinking that have influenced some of the world's leading organizations. Originality/value: The briefing saves busy executives and researchers hours of reading time by selecting only the very best, most pertinent information and presenting it in a condensed and easy-to digest format. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Adaptability; Collaboration; Flexibility; Future; Organizational planning; Strategic planning; Strategy; Vision",,"Parke, C., Preparation meets strategic planning: Organizations without a vision for the future won't get there (2012) Industrial Engineer, 44 (1), pp. 44-48; Reeves, M., Love, C., Tillmanns, P., Your strategy needs a strategy (2012) Harvard Business Review, , September; Sibony, O., Collaborative strategic planning: Three observations (2012) The McKinsey Quarterly, (2), pp. 94-97",,,,02580543,,,,"English","Strateg.

From 1968, this took the form of structure plans. In 2004, however, these were replaced by Regional Spatial Strategies (RSS). Then in May 2010, the Conservative Party announced it would abolish RSS and with it, we would argue, strategic planning in any meaningful sense of the word. The incoming Coalition Government followed through on this. This article looks at the implications of RSS abolition and the consequences, looking in particular at its implication for economic growth and investment in more prosperous, southern England.","38 southern England; economic growth; planning framework; spatial strategy; strategic planning","economic growth; historical perspective; investment; planning history; spatial analysis; strategic approach; town planning; England; United Kingdom","Albrechts, L., Strategy planning and regional governance in Europe.

Although there is agreement that there should be greater coordination of initiatives and resources, there is little guidance in the literature to address the method to achieve the necessary transformation. Traditional approaches to strategic planning often engage a few leaders and produce a set of immeasurable initiatives. A nontraditional approach, consisting of a Whole-Scale (Dannemiller Tyson Associates, Ann Arbor, MI) engagement, appreciative inquiry, and a balanced scorecard can, more rapidly transform an academic health center. Using this nontraditional approach to strategic planning, increased organizational awareness was achieved in a single academic health center. Strategic planning can be an effective tool to achieve alignment, enhance accountability, and a first step in meeting the demands of the new landscape of healthcare.",,"health care planning; health care policy; human; motivation; organization and management; review; United States; university hospital; Academic Medical Centers; Goals; Health Planning Guidelines; Health Planning Organizations; Humans; Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; United States",,"Higginbotham, E.J.email: ejh@post.harvard.edu",,,00657778,,,23303997,"English","Trans.

In this highly swarming context towards process intensification, this article provides an overview of the different strategies which are reported in the literature to perform syngas or H 2 purification and conditioning into the gasifier. A promising avenue towards process intensification consists in integrating several functionalities into suitable fluidized bed gasifiers, such as catalytic tar cracking/reforming, CO 2 elimination, H 2 separation and the elimination of particles and other contaminants. The development of new catalytic integrated gasification concepts is also proposed to achieve high conversion performances while pursuing significant process intensification. This strategy is illustrated by relevant examples such as the design of short contact time partial oxidation catalytic reactors, the implementation of specific reaction media such as supercritical water or molten metal, or the realisation of a close contact between solid catalysts and lignocellulosic biomass. Most of these different technologies are not mature yet and research effort has to be performed for optimizing each of these approaches, calling for a multidisciplinary and multi-scale approach integrating catalysis, chemistry, reaction and process engineering. The design of new advanced gasification reactor concept still has to be pursued in order to achieve the challenging one-step production of a high quality syngas from biomass gasification. The implementation of such innovative biomass gasification breakthrough concepts could be one of the most promising ways of process intensification resulting in a significant cut down of the production costs of synthesis gas and H 2 derived from biomass. Graphical abstract: Application of the process intensification concept to biomass gasification is a promising way to cut down the production costs of synthesis gas and H 2 derived from biomass and requires a multidisciplinary and multi-scale approach integrating catalysis, chemistry, reaction and process engineering. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The document aims to propose guidelines for a strategic re-planning of the Brazilian ceramic tiles sector, making the Brazilian producers aware of the national market fragility (in spite of its recent remarkable evolution) and helping the policy makers to reflect on the need of reviewing the strategic planning methods and practice, of designing new targeted programs (based on coherence between operation and business strategies), of providing improved management to strengthen the sector against unfair competition by low-cost producers, enhancing the necessary infrastructure in technology, work, marketing and quality management. The analysis is limited to the single-firing production technology. The wide-coverage strategic analysis of the Brazilian ceramic tiles sector, very little studied until now in a scientific way, emphasizes the importance of applying research methodology and may be valuable to both scholars and practitioners. Additionally, it highlights the need of investments in innovation (product design and production technology) and the fundamental role of the sector organization, identifying different dimensions. It is possible to conclude that the recent Brazilian production growth is not due to a natural strengthening because of the hit of the sector and of correct enterprises strategy, but it seems the result of a temporary and favorable economic contingency.","Ceramic tile production; Cluster analysis; Organizational structures; Regional development; Sector analysis; Strategic management",,"(2011) Confindustria Ceramica: 31 a Indagine Statistica sull'Industria Italiana - Anno 2010, , www.confindustriaceramica.it/asso/articoli.nsf/VSNWOI/ 0E7B15F26235F578C1256C910034585F#, Available at, (accessed 15 July 2011); (2011) Anfacer: Setor cerâmico Brasileiro Cresce 8,2 % no Mercado Interno em 2010, , www.anfacer.org.br, Available at, (accessed 20 October 2011); (2009) Anfacer: Censo, , www.anfacer.org.br, Available at, (accessed 20 October 2010); (2011) Industria e Comércio Exterior: Importações Brasileiras, , www.aliceweb.mdic.gov.br, Ministério do Desenvolvimento, Available at, (accessed 24 February 2011); Nassetti, G., Palmonari, C., Moagem fina a seco e granulação vs. moagem a úmido e atomização na preparação de massas de base vermelha para monoqueima ŕipida de pisos vidrados (1997) Cerâmica Industriai, 2 (5-6), pp. 11-15; Araujo, A., Romachelli, J.C., Martins, M., Análise crítica do setor de revestimento cerâmico no Brasil, Parte I: Histórico recente (2001) Cerâmica Industriai, 6 (4), pp. 29-34; Sharma, M., Kodali, R., Development of a framework for manufacturing excellence (2008) Measuring Business Excellence, 12 (4), pp. 50-66; Constantino, A.O., Da Rosa, S.E.S., Corrêa, A.R., Panorama do Setor de Revestimentos Cerâmicos, 2006. , www.bndes.gov.br/SiteBNDES/bndes/bndes_pt/lnstitucional/Publicacoes/ Consulta_Expressa/Setor/Ceramico/200609_5.html, Available at, (accessed 26 October 2010); Nogueira, E., Alves, A.G., Torkomian, A.L., Empresas de revestimento cerâmico e suas estratégias competitivas e de produção (2001) Gestão e ProduçãO, 8 (1), pp. 84-99; Taticchi, P., Tonelli, F., Cagnazzo, L., Performance measurement and management.

I argue that these changes affected the justices' voting patterns in systematic ways. My assertion is that the end of appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council removes a constraint on Supreme Court decision-making, which had led to strategic voting by the justices in the period during which the JCPC could examine and reverse the Supreme Court's decisions. For the Charter of Rights, I assert that its existence as a legal document served as a constraint for conservative justices on the Court in the period immediately following its passage. Drawing on the universe of decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada from 1945 to 2005 in criminal, tax, and tort cases, I use Baum's (1988, 1989) method of examining policy change on the Supreme Court over time. I examine judicial votes before and after the Supreme Court becomes a court of last resort in 1949, and before and after passage of the Charter of Rights in 1982. Then, I employ a logistic regression model in the Charter of Rights period and a comparison of Supreme Court of Canada and JCPC voting in the 1949 period. I find support for the assertion that justices will vote strategically when faced with threat of reversal. The Charter of Rights also appears to have a constraining effect. Its mandate as a progressive document appears to have a constraining effect on conservative justices' voting patterns, at least in the short-term following its passage. © 2012 ACSUS.","Charter of Rights; Judicial behavior; Judicial Committee of the Privy Council; Strategic decision-making; Supreme Court of Canada","decision making; institutional development; social justice; strategic approach; voting behavior; Canada","Alarie, B., Green, A.J., Policy preference change and appointments to the supreme court of Canada (2009) Osgoode Hall Law Journal, 47 (1), pp. 1-46; Alarie, B., Green, A.J., Charter decisions in the McLachlin era: Consensus and ideology at the supreme court of Canada (2009) Supreme Court Law Review, 47, pp. 475-511; Baar, C., Judicial activism in Canada (1991) Judicial Activism in Comparative Perspective, , Ed.

Additionally, individual performance of treatment stages and changes in sewage flows and loads have to be considered to achieve an optimised outcome. Typically, large scale capital projects are required to address the many challenges that face a WWTP. However, significant cost savings can be made if smaller optimisation projects are pursued to maximise the capacity of existing infrastructure and therefore defer high cost capital upgrades. To achieve this end, SA Water started a formal process to review the capacity of each process element of the Bolivar WWTP and found several opportunities to optimise current process performance. Based on these outcomes a future strategy document was developed that enables the next major plant upgrade to be deferred by 8-10 years. This paper summarises SA Water's approach to develop such a documentation to allow a strategic asset management, optimise its capital expenditure and achieve significant cost savings. It also highlights some of the projects that were identified during this process to improve the current treatment plant performance. © IWA Publishing 2012.","Asset management; Process optimisation; Process review; Strategic planning","Capital expenditures; Capital projects; Cost saving; Current treatments; Effluent quality; Future strategy; High costs; Individual performance; Optimisations; Plant upgrades; Process elements; Process optimisation; Process performance; Sewage flow; Strategic asset managements; Strategic investments; Asset management; Costs; Optimization; Sewage; Strategic planning; Water quality; Investments","Baumann, P., Roth, M., (2008) Reduction of the Energy Consumption on WWTPs-Handbook for Operators, , Senkung des Stromverbrauchs auf Kläranlagen, Leitfaden für das Betriebspersonal, Heft 4, DWA Landesverband Baden, Württemberg; Rosso, D., Larson, L.E., Stenstrom, M.K., Aeration of large-scale municipal wastewater treatment plants: State of the art (2008) Water Sci.

Accounting for human population movement (HPM) in planning for control, elimination and post-elimination surveillance is important, as evidenced by previous elimination attempts that were undermined by the reintroduction of malaria through HPM. Strategic control and elimination planning, therefore, requires quantitative information on HPM patterns and the translation of these into parasite dispersion. HPM patterns and the risk of malaria vary substantially across spatial and temporal scales, demographic and socioeconomic sub-groups, and motivation for travel, so multiple data sets are likely required for quantification of movement. While existing studies based on mobile phone call record data combined with malaria transmission maps have begun to address withincountry HPM patterns, other aspects remain poorly quantified despite their importance in accurately gauging malaria movement patterns and building control and detection strategies, such as cross-border HPM, demographic and socioeconomic stratification of HPM patterns, forms of transport, personal malaria protection and other factors that modify malaria risk. A wealth of data exist to aid filling these gaps, which, when combined with spatial data on transport infrastructure, traffic and malaria transmission, can answer relevant questions to guide strategic planning. This review aims to (i) discuss relevant types of HPM across spatial and temporal scales, (ii) document where datasets exist to quantify HPM, (iii) highlight where data gaps remain and (iv) briefly put forward methods for integrating these datasets in a Geographic Information System (GIS) framework for analysing and modelling human population and Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection movements. © 2012 Pindolia et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"adolescent; adult; bed net; geographic information system; human; human population movement; malaria control; malaria falciparum; male; mobile phone; nonhuman; Plasmodium falciparum; population movement pattern; review; social class; strategic planning; Communicable Disease Control; Emigration and Immigration; Geographic Information Systems; Health Planning; Humans; Malaria; Malaria, Falciparum; Plasmodium falciparum; Transients and Migrants; Travel; World Health","Katz, I., Komatsu, R., Low-Beer, D., Atun, R., Scaling up towards international targets for AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria: Contribution of global fund-supported programs in 2011-2015 (2011) PLoS One, 6, p. 517166. , 10.1371/journal.pone.0017166 21383839; Snow, R.W., Guerra, C.A., Mutheu, J.J., Hay, S.I., International funding for malaria control in relation to populations at risk of stable Plasmodium falciparum transmission (2008) PLoS Med, 5, p. 5142. , 10.1371/journal.pmed.0050142 18651785; Aregawi, M.W., Ali, A.S., Al-Mafazy, A.W., Molteni, F., Katikiti, S., Warsame, M., Njau, R.J., Otten, M., Reductions in malaria and anaemia case and death burden at hospitals following scale-up of malaria control in Zanzibar, 1999-2008 (2011) Malar J, 10, p. 46. , 10.1186/1475-2875-10-46 21332989; Chizema-Kawesha, E., Miller, J.M., Steketee, R.W., Mukonka, V.M., Mukuka, C., Mohamed, A.D., Miti, S.K., Campbell, C.C., Scaling up malaria control in Zambia: Progress and impact 2005-2008 (2010) AmJTrop Med Hyg, 83, pp. 480-488; Akachi, Y., Atun, R., Effect of investment in malaria control on child mortality in sub-saharan Africa in 2002-2008 (2011) PLoS One, 6, p. 521309. , 10.1371/journal.pone.0021309 21738633; Okiro, E.A., Hay, S.I., Gikandi, P.W., Sharif, S.K., Noor, A.M., Peshu, N., Marsh, K., Snow, R.W., The decline in paediatric malaria admissions on the coast of Kenya (2007) Malar J, 6, p. 151. , 10.1186/1475-2875-6-151 18005422; Okiro, E.A., Alegana, V.A., Noor, A.M., Mutheu, J.J., Juma, E., Snow, R.W., Malaria paediatric hospitalization between 1999 and 2008 across Kenya (2009) BMC Med, 7, p. 75. , 10.1186/1741-7015-7-75 20003178; Singh, N., Nagpal, A.C., Saxena, A., Singh, M.P., Changing scenario of malaria in central India, the replacement of Plasmodium vivax by Plasmodium falciparum (1986-2000) (2004) Tropical Medicine and International Health, 9 (3), pp. 364-371. , DOI 10.1046/j.1365-3156.2003.01181.x; Tanner, M., De Savigny, D., Malaria eradication back on the table (2008) Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 86 (2), p. 82. , http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/2/07-050633.pdf, DOI 10.2471/BLT.07.050633; (2011) Atlas of Malaria-Eliminating Countries, 2011, , The Global Health Group, Global Health Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco; Najera, J.A., Gonzalez-Silva, M., Alonso, P.L., Some lessons for the future from the Global Malaria Eradication Programme (1955-1969) (2011) PLoS Med, 8, p. 51000412. , 10.1371/journal.pmed.1000412 21311585; Bruce-Chwatt, L.J., Malaria and its control: Present situation and future prospects (1987) Annu Rev Public Health, 8, pp. 75-110. , 10.1146/annurev.pu.08.050187.000451 3555531; Cohen, J.M., Smith, D.L., Cotter, C., Ward, A., Yamey, G., Sabot, O.J., Moonen, B., Resurgent malaria: A systematic review and assessment of its causes (2012) Malar J, , in press; Martens, P., Hall, L., Malaria on the move: Human population movement and malaria transmission (2000) Emerging Infectious Diseases, 6 (2), pp. 103-109; Lemenach, A., Tatem, A.J., Cohen, J.M., Hay, S.I., Randell, H., Patil, A., Smith, D.L., Travel risk, malaria importation, and malaria transmission in Zanzibar (2011) Scientic Reports, 1, p. 93; (2007) Malaria Elimination: A Field Manual for Low and Moderate Endemic Countries, , World Health Organization, Geneva; Moonen, B., Barrett, S., Tulloch, J., Jamison, D.T., Making the decision (2009) Shrinking the Malaria Map: A Prospectus on Malaria Elimination, pp. 1-18. , University of California, San Francisco; Craig, M.H., Kleinschmidt, I., Le Sueur, D., Sharp, B.L., Exploring 30 years of malaria case data in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: Part II.

Coalitions have been an important vehicle for addressing similar intractable and deeply rooted health-related issues. A root cause analysis process may aid coalitions in identifying fundamental, structural-level contributors to risk and in identifying appropriate solutions. For this article, strategic plans for 13 coalitions were analyzed both before and after a root cause analysis approach was applied to determine the coalitions' strategic plans potential impact and comprehensiveness. After root cause analysis, strategic plans trended toward targeting policies and practices rather than on single agency programmatic changes. Plans expanded to target multiple sectors and several changes within sectors to penetrate deeply into a sector or system. Findings suggest that root cause analysis may be a viable tool to assist coalitions in identifying structural determinants and possible solutions for HIV risk. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","HIV prevention; HIV risk factors; structural factors; structural interventions","adolescent; article; community care; female; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; male; organization and management; participatory research; Puerto Rico; risk factor; root cause analysis; United States; Adolescent; Community Networks; Community-Based Participatory Research; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Male; Planning Techniques; Puerto Rico; Risk Factors; Root Cause Analysis; United States","Altman, D.G., Strategies for community health intervention: Promises, paradoxes and pitfalls (1994) Psychosomatic Medicine, 57 (3), pp. 226-233; Anderson, R.M., May, R.M., (1991) Infectious Diseases of Humans: Dynamics and Control.

Prior to 1982, Kenneth Andrews, Igor Ansoff, and Michael Porter gave strong emphasis to strategic planning and positioning choices by firms in industries to achieve better performance. The chief executive officer, top management team, and strategic planners were the most influential actors within firms in the strategy process through the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. However, with the OPEC I and OPEC II oil shocks adversely impacting economic activity in industrialised countries in the 1970s and early 1980s, the expected planningperformance relationship for organisations was increasingly questioned. Circumstances required that firms become more agile and adaptive to economic and market challenges in the 1980s. This created an opportunity in 1982 for the contribution of McKinsey and Co consultants including Tom Peters, Robert Waterman, and Kenichi Ohmae to start to focus attention in the strategy discipline on organisations developing fast, flexible strategic thinking practice. This has had implications for the role of top managers in strategy process. This paper uses mixed methods to explore this outcome and report key findings on the modern role of top managers in the strategy process.","Qualitative interviews; Strategy process; Stratified sample; Top managers; Uncertainty",,"Andersen, T.J., Strategic planning, autonomous actions and corporate performance (2000) Long Range Planning, 33, pp. 184-199; Andrews, K.R., (1965) The Concept of Corporate Strategy, , Homewood Illinois: Dow JonesIrwin; Ansoff, H.I., (1965) Corporate Strategy, , New York: McGraw-Hill; Bonn, I., (1996) Strategic Management in Australian Organisations, , Unpublished Doctor of Philosophy Thesis Swinburne University Melbourne; Burgelman, R., Grove, A., Let Chaos reign, then rein in Chaos-repeatedly: Managing strategic dynamics for corporate longevity (2007) Strategic Management Journal, 28, pp. 965-979; Coakes, S.J., Steed, L.G., (2001) SPSS Analysis Without Anguish, , Milton, Qld: John Wiley and Sons; Crabtree, B.F., Miller, W.L., (1992) Doing Qualitative Research, , Newbury Park, Ca: Sage Publications; Finkelstein, S., Hambrick, D., (1996) Strategic Leadership: Top Executives and Their Effects on Organisations, , St Paul Mn: West; Gavetti, G., Levinthal, D.A., Rivkin, J.W., Strategy making in novel and complex worlds: The power of analogy (2005) Strategic Management Journal, 26 (8), pp. 691-712. , DOI 10.1002/smj.475; Gavetti, G., Levinthal, D., Rivkin, J., Response to Farjoun's strategy making, novelty and analogical reasoning-commentary on Gavetti, Levinthal and Rivkin (2005) (2008) Strategic Management Journal, 29, pp. 1017-1021; Hambrick, D.C., The top management team: Key to strategic success (1987) California Management Review, Fall, pp. 88-108; Hamel, G., (2000) Leading the Revolution, , Boston MA: Harvard Business School Press; Hart, S., An integrative framework for strategy-making processes (1992) Academy of Management Review, 17 (2), pp. 327-351; Hart, S., Banbury, C., How strategy making processes can make a difference (1994) Strategic Management Journal, 15, pp. 251-269; Heracleous, L., Strategic thinking or strategic planning?

With increasing water demand and scarcity, utilities require effective strategies for optimum use of available water resources. Diverse water loss reduction options exist. Deciding on which option to choose amidst conflicting multiple criteria and different interests of stakeholders is a challenging task. In this paper, an integrated multi-criteria decision-aiding framework for strategic planning of water loss management is presented. The PROMETHEE II method was applied within the framework in prioritizing water loss reduction options for Kampala city. A strategic plan that combines selective mains and service lines replacement and pressure management as priorities is the best compromise based on preferences of the decision makers and seven evaluation criteria characterized by financial-economic, environmental, public health, technical and social impacts. The results show that the most preferred options are those that enhance water supply reliability, public health and water conservation measures. This study demonstrates how decision theory coupled with operational research techniques could be applied in practice to solve complex water management and planning problems. © 2011 The Author(s).","Decision-aid; Multi-criteria; PROMETHEE; Strategic planning; Water loss reduction","Available water; Conservation measures; Decision makers; Decision-aid; Evaluation criteria; Multi-criteria; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Multiple criteria; Operational research; Planning problem; Pressure management; PROMETHEE; Public health; Service line; Social impact; Strategic plan; Supply reliability; Water demand; Water loss; Water loss management; Water loss reduction; Water utility; Decision theory; Developing countries; Electric utilities; Strategic planning; Water conservation; Water management; Water supply; Decision making; decision analysis; developing world; multicriteria analysis; public health; strategic approach; water demand; water management; water planning; water supply; Central Province [Uganda]; Kampala; Uganda","Abrishamchi, A., Ebrahimian, A., Tajrishi, M., Marino, M.A., Case study: application of multicriteria decision making to urban water supply (2005) J Water Resour Plann Manag, 131 (4), pp. 326-335; Afshar, A., Marino, M.A., Saadatpour, M., Afshar, A., Fuzzy TOPSIS multicriteria decision analysis applied to Karun reservoir system (2011) Water Resour Manag, 25, pp. 545-563; Alegre, H., Baptista, J.M., Cabrera, E.J., Cubillo, F., Hirner, W., Merkel, W., Parena, R., (2006) Performance Indicators For Water Supply Services, , IWA Manual of Best Practice, IWA Publishing, 2nd edn; Alvisi, S., Franchini, M., Multiobjective optimization of rehabilitation and leakage detection scheduling in water distribution systems (2009) J Water Resour Plann Manag, 135 (6), pp. 426-439; Araujo, L.S., Ramos, H., Coelho, S.T., Pressure control for leakage minimisation in water distribution systems management (2006) Water Resources Management, 20 (1), pp. 133-149; Arregui, F.J., Cobacho, R., Cabrera Jr., E., Espert, V., Graphical method to calculate the optimum replacement period for water meters (2011) J Water Resour Plann Manag, 137 (1), pp. 143-146; (2009) Water Audits and Loss Control Programs, , AWWA, AWWA manual M36., American Water Works Association, Denver, USA; Behzadian, M., Kazemzadeh, R.B., Albadvi, A., Aghdasi, M., PROMETHEE: a comprehensive literature review on methodologies and applications (2010) Eur J Oper Res, 200, pp. 198-215; Bouchard, C., Abi-Zeid, I., Beauchamp, N., Lamontagne, L., Desrosiers, J., Multicriteria decision analysis for the selection of a small drinking water system (2010) J Water Supply: Res Technol-AQUA, 59 (4), pp. 230-242; Brans, J.P., Mareschal, B., PROMETHEE methods (2005) Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis: State of the Art Surveys, pp. 163-189. , J.

Design/methodology/approach: The article presents a case study of Indra, a leading Spanish technology company, showing how it has integrated corporate social responsibility within its strategic objectives. Findings: What can you do to get and keep that competitive edge? One firm thinks it has found the answer by incorporating ethical behavior and corporate social responsibility (CSR) into every aspect of its activities. It seems that a corporate culture focused on ethical behavior can improve your standing and reputation inside and outside the company, so that employees, shareholders and communities at large see the organization as ready to do the right thing, rather than motivated exclusively by making money. Practical implications: The article explains how basing competitive advantage on ethics and social responsibility can benefit stakeholders and improve long-term profitability in a technology-driven company. It shows how embedding ethical considerations and CSR as a basic aspect of strategy development and communicating this approach to stakeholders affects employee motivation and behavior, together with company reputation.

The agricultural sector is so extensive that achievement of national goals and high levels of development is practically unattainable without active participation by farmers. Provision of a combination of agricultural functional requirements by cooperatives would lead to enhancement of the standard of living of their members. Rural production cooperatives, also known as agricultural cooperatives, are defined as a modern construct with their own specific organization and management. Cooperatives incorporate their own ruling principles, structures, networks, rules, regulations, and bylaws. These features provide concrete benefits in the process of agricultural development. This paper aims to review the activities of rural agricultural production cooperatives in Iran and propose a strategic planning approach for development and institutionalization of their operations. This qualitative research was conducted in Iran using case study and purposeful sampling method. The proposed strategies for promotion of production cooperatives include: provision of support in terms of financial credits, organizational and management expertise, technical know-how and technology, equipment and training, empowerment of members aimed at transforming them into successful farm managers, promotion of team work among members, and extraction of appropriate information and practical advice from research data provided by contemporary investigations. In conclusion, it is proposed that establishment of cooperatives alongside other issues should be considered by policy makers and local leaders and representatives trusted by farmers be involved in their implementation. © 2011 Academic Journals.","Cooperation; Participation; Production cooperative; Strategic planning; Strategy",,"Aghaya, G., Shirzad, M., Setoudenia, N., The role of cooperatives in sustainable development of rural areas (2005) Development and Cooperation Conference, pp. 2-27. , Isfahan, Azad University of Khorasgan.

Additionally, no study has examined the operational effects of these decisions in-depth. The purpose of this paper is to fill these two gaps in the academic literature. Design/methodology/approach: A literature review confirms the existence of these gaps and informs hypotheses based on the three theories. Additionally, the model for continuous decision making on outsourcing is used to systematically collect data from five cases studies. The cases - all make-to-order or engineering-to-order - have been analysed on effects for operational performance and control resulting from strategic decision making on outsourcing. Findings: From this evaluation, it appears that these companies perform weakly on the control of the outsourced activities. Furthermore, it seems that the (manufacturing) strategy is disconnected from outsourcing practices and that outsourcing hardly contributes to competitive advantage. Moreover, from some of the case studies it appears that the decision for strategic outsourcing is irreversible. Finally, traditional criteria and behaviour during decision making prevail, i.e. a cost-driven perspective, which does not address contemporary challenges. Research limitations/implications: Despite being explorative and based on only five cases, these findings indicate that strategic decision making on outsourcing based on the three theories insufficiently accounts for operational issues that emerge later during manufacturing; it might be necessary to revise the theoretical base for outsourcing to include management of outsourced manufacturing activities. Practical implications: The findings imply also that managers in companies, in any case those firms that operate on the basis of make-to-order or engineering-to-order, should be less ""rushed"" into strategic decision making on outsourcing that has adverse effects. Rather, outsourcing requires integral decision making in contrast to factual decision making that displayed signs of bounded rationality (particularly expressed through the focus on cost savings). Social implications: The dominant, one-sided view of the cost perspectives contributes to the notion that the shareholders' interests for short-term profitability conflict with long-term organisational health (apparent through the impact on operational management of outsourcing activities). Originality/value: Stakeholders involved in strategic decision making might use this research to evaluate fundamentally decisions that cover outsourcing. At the same time, for consultants and practitioners it offers insight that is complementary to the often one-sided strategic decision making with its focus on cost reductions. Furthermore, this paper demonstrates the limited validity of current theories that underpin strategic decision making on outsourcing and provides an impetus for academics to develop more appropriate theory. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Decision making; Manufacturing systems; Operations management; Outsourcing",,"Akarte, M.M., Surendra, N.V., Ravi, B., Rangaraj, N., Web based casting supplier evaluation using analytical hierarchy process (2001) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 52 (5), pp. 511-522; Allan, G., A critique of using grounded theory as a research method (2003) Electronic Journal of Business Research Methods, 2 (1), pp. 1-10; Arnold, U., New dimensions of outsourcing: A combination of transaction cost economics and the core competencies concept (2000) European Journal of Purchasing & Supply Management, 6 (1), pp. 23-29; Avella, L., Focal points in manufacturing strategic planning in Spain (1999) International Journal of Operations & Production Management, 19 (12), pp. 1292-1317; Azevedo, A.L., Sousa, J.P., Order planning for networked make-to-order enterprises - a case study (2000) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 51 (10), pp. 1116-1127; Barney, J.B., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage (1991) Journal of Management, 17 (1), pp. 99-120; Barthélemy, J., The seven deadly sins of outsourcing (2003) Academy of Management Executive, 17 (2), pp. 87-100; Berggren, C., Bengtsson, L., Rethinking outsourcing in manufacturing: A tale of two telecom firms (2004) European Management Journal, 22 (2), pp. 211-223; Blaxill, M.F., Hout, T.M., The fallacy of the overhead quick fix (1991) Harvard Business Review, 69 (4), pp. 93-101; Broedner, P., Kinkel, S., Lay, G., Productivity effects of outsourcing: New evidence on the strategic importance of vertical integration decisions (2009) International Journal of Operations & Production Management, 29 (2), pp. 127-150; Busi, M., McIvor, R., Setting the outsourcing research agenda: The top-10 most urgent outsourcing areas (2008) Strategic Outsourcing: An International Journal, 1 (3), pp. 185-197; Butala, P., Sluga, A., Dynamic structuring of distributed manufacturing systems (2002) Advanced Engineering Informatics, 16 (2), pp. 127-133; Cánez, L.E., Platts, K.W., Probert, D.R., Developing a framework for make-or-buy decisions (2000) International Journal of Operations & Production Management, 20 (11), pp. 1313-1330; Caputo, A.C., Palumbo, M., Manufacturing re-insourcing in the textile industry (2005) Industrial Management & Data Systems, 105 (2), pp. 193-207; Choi, T.Y., Hartley, J.L., An exploration of supplier selection practices across the supply chain (1996) Journal of Operations Management, 14 (4), pp. 333-343; Coase, R.H., The nature of the firm (1937) Economica, 4 (16), pp. 386-405; Cua, K.O., McKone, K.E., Schroeder, R.G., Relationships between implementation of TQM, JIT, and TPM and manufacturing performance (2001) Journal of Operations Management, 19 (6), pp. 675-694; Das, T.K., Teng, B.-S., Trust, control, and risk in strategic alliances: An integrated framework (2001) Organization Studies, 22 (2), pp. 251-283; de Boer, L., Gayton, J., Arroyo, P., A satisficing model of outsourcing (2006) Supply Chain Management: An International Journal, 11 (5), pp. 444-455; Dekkers, R., Decision models for outsourcing and core competencies in manufacturing (2000) International Journal of Production Research, 38 (7), pp. 4085-4096; Dekkers, R., Strategic capacity management: Meeting technological demands and performance criteria (2002) International Journal of Production Research, 40 (15), pp. 3895-3911; Dekkers, R., (2005) (R)Evolution, Organizations and the Dynamics of the Environment, , Springer, New York, NY; Dekkers, R., Engineering management and the order entry point (2006) International Journal of Production Research, 44 (18-19), pp. 4011-4025; Dekkers, R., Bennett, D., Industrial networks of the future: Review of research and practice (2009) Dispersed Manufacturing Networks: Challenges for Research and Practice, pp. 13-34. , Dekkers, R.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper outlines a case study example of the use of the QFD methodology. It looks at how well it was able to achieve its objectives. Findings: Meeting customer expectations and creating customer satisfaction has become the Holy Grail for companies wishing to improve their competitiveness and profitability. Success, however, for many companies remains illusive. Their ability to align and integrate customer satisfaction with their overall strategic direction has proved to be more difficult that they thought. Their repeated desire to put the customer first is severely hampered by the lack of effective methodologies and tools to support the creation of an integrated process. Companies need a mechanism for aligning important concepts - a tool that will outline the important steps that they need to implement in order to successfully identify business priorities. One company, Geotherm Sri, a firm producing geothermal heat pumps, adopted QFD to help them with their strategic planning and achieve customer satisfaction. How well did QFD meet the challenge? Practical implications: The paper provides a step-by-step guide of how to apply the QFD methodology to the task of defining business priorities. Social implications: The paper improves corporate strategic decision making and allows for a more in-depth analysis of customer expectations/needs. Originality/value: The paper identifies the various steps involved in applying the QFD. It adopts a case study example that will help company strategic decision makers in their quest to determine their business priorities. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Customer orientation; Customer services quality; Quality function deployment; Strategic choices; Strategic objectives; Strategic planning",,"Maritan, D., Panizzolo, R., Identifying business priorities through quality function deployment (2009) Marketing Intelligence & Planning, 27 (5), pp. 714-728. , ISSN 0263-4503",,,,02580543,,,,"English","Strateg.

This conception emphasizes the importance to study and to formulate a method of strategic planning and management of production systems. In that sense, the main objective of this paper is to present a methodology to identify and analyze a production chain (or Agro-industrial System, SAG) in a systemic way. For this purpose, the paperoutlines the method of Strategic Planning and Management of Productive Systems for Improving Competitiveness (GESis), developed from the review of nine methodological proposals for strategic planning. In that sense, the GESis method facilitates the implementation of vertical organization capable of implementing the strategies and shaping an associativeculture. However, it also has limitations such as the simplification of the processes of strategic management, the possible exclusion of literature containing other methods of strategic management, and the lack of validation of its empirical applicability.","Agro-industrial systems; Gesis method; Planning; Strategic management",,"Anderson, E., Weitz, B.A., Make-orbuy decisions: Vertical integration and marketing productivity (1986) Sloan Management Review, 27 (3), pp. 3-20; Andrews, K.R., (1987) The Concept of Corporate Strategy, , Chicago: Irwin, Homewood, IL, 3 a Ed; Ansoff, H.I., (1987) Corporate Strategy: An Analytic Approach to Business Police for Growth and Expansion, , New York: McGraw-Hill, 1965. revised; Batalha, M.O., (2001) Gestão Agroindustrial, 1, pp. 23-63. , Coord, 2 o Ed.

Public utility service providers have often been seen as lacking the capacity to identify and/ or implement the needed transformation processes. Instead, privatization has been proposed as a panacea to remedy this deficit. However, privatization projects are often not realized because they encounter strong political opposition. This article presents the results of strategic planning projects in three public wastewater organizations in Switzerland. This study suggests that if appropriate processes are implemented, public utility organizations are able to overcome their limitations in identifying the relevant capability deficits and select adequate strategies to compensate for the deficits. While these strategies may deviate substantially across utilities due to differences in the goals pursued, the widespread adoption of strategic planning methods by public utilities represents a viable alternative to privatization.",,,"(2006) Infrastructure to 2030: Telecom, Land Transport, Water and Eledricity, , OECD, Paris: OECD Publishing;

To avoid this effect, the facilitators of the process conducted a series of interviews with external stakeholders and analyzed available gray literature on regional developments with a potential impact on the utility. The workshop participants were confronted throughout the process with the information that resulted from this analysis.

Preliminary survey results show the need for point-of-care testing (POCT) devices using test clusters that specifically detect pathogens found in disaster scenarios. Hurricane Katrina, the tsunami in southeast Asia, and the current influenza pandemic (H1N1, ""swine flu"") vividly illustrate lack of national and global preparedness. Gap analysis of current POCT devices versus survey results reveals how POCT needs can be fulfilled. Future thinking will help avoid the worst consequences of disasters on the horizon, such as extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis and pandemic influenzas. A global effort must be made to improve POC technologies to rapidly diagnose and treat patients to improve triaging, on-site decision making, and, ultimately, economic and medical outcomes. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The leadership formed the vision and then embarked on a comprehensive and coordinated planning process that addressed financial, clinical, academic, and operational issues.The authors describe in depth the strategic planning process and specifically the definition of UK HealthCare's role in its medical marketplace. They began a rigorous process to assess and develop goals for the clinical programs and followed the progress of these programs through meetings driven by data and attended by the organization's senior leadership. They describe their approach to working with rural and community hospitals throughout central, eastern, and southern Kentucky to support the health care infrastructure of the state. They review the early successes of their strategic approach and describe the lessons they learned. The clinical successes have led to academic gains. The experience of UK HealthCare suggests that good business practices and good public policy are synergistic. © 2009 Association of American Medical Colleges.",,"cardiology; community; community hospital; decision making; demography; disease severity; financial management; gastroenterology; goal attainment; health care; health care access; health care cost; health care policy; health care system; health program; hospital management; human; leadership; marketing; medical education; monitoring; neuroscience; oncology; organization and management; orthopedics; patient referral; pediatrics; priority journal; review; rural area; scoring system; strategic planning; transplantation; United States; university; article; financial management; health care delivery; health services research; organization; program development; university hospital; Academic Medical Centers; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Kentucky; Marketing of Health Services; Organizational Affiliation; Organizational Case Studies; Program Development","Lofgren, R., Karpf, M., Perman, J., Higdon, C.M., The U.S. health care system is in crisis: Implications for academic medical centers and their missions (2006) Academic Medicine, 81 (8), pp. 713-720. , DOI 10.1097/00001888-200608000-00007, PII 0000188820060800000007; Employee Benefits Survey, , http://www.bls.gov/ncs/ebs, U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics Available at: Accessed October 23, 2008; Himmelstein, D.U., Warren, E., Thorne, D., Wollhandler, S., Illness and injury as contributors to bankruptcy (2005) Health Aff, , (Millwood) January-June (suppl Web exclusives):W5-63-W5-73; Robertson, T., (2007) At the Crest of the Wave: The Threat of Incrementalism, , Oak Brook, Ill: University HealthSystem Consortium; October; Lee, T.H., Meyer, G.S., Brennen, T.A., A middle ground on public accountability (2004) N Engl J Med, 350, pp. 2409-2412; Tables and Graphs Summarizing U.S. Medical School Revenues for FY2006, , http://www.aamc.org/data/finance/2006tables/start.htm, Association of American Medical Colleges Available at Accessed October 23, 2008; Karpf, M., Perman, J., Lofgren, R., Melgar, S., Butler, F., Day, Z., Clark, M., Higdon, C.M., Creating an integrated clinical enterprise at the University of Kentucky: The emergence of UK HealthCare (2007) Academic Medicine, 82 (12), pp. 1163-1171. , DOI 10.1097/ACM.0b013e318159e155, PII 0000188820071200000011","Karpf, M.; Office of the Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, 317 Wethington Building, 900 South Limestone, Lexington, KY 40536-0200, United States; email: mkarpf@email.uky.edu",,"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins",10402446,,ACMEE,19174658,"English","Acad.

We approach this problem from a neurocognitive perspective. We see profound incompatibilities between the cognitive process - deductive reasoning - channeled into the collective mind of strategists within the formal planning process through its tools of strategic analysis (i.e., rational technologies) and the essentially inductive reasoning process actually needed to address ill-defined, complex strategic situations. Thus, strategic analysis protocols that may appear to be and, indeed, are entirely rational and logical are not interpretable as such at the neuronal substrate level where thinking takes place. The analytical structure (or propositional representation) of these tools results in a mental dead end, the phenomenon known in cognitive psychology as functional fixedness. The difficulty lies with the inability of the brain to make out meaningful (i.e., strategy-provoking) stimuli from the mental images (or depictive representations) generated by strategic analysis tools. We propose decreasing dependence on these tools and conducting further research employing brain imaging technology to explore complex data handling protocols with richer mental representation and greater potential for strategy creation. © 2007 New York Academy of Sciences.","Cognitive neuroscience; Management cognition; Mental models; Neurocognition; Strategic planning; Strategic thinking; Strategy process","analytic method; cognition; decision making; evidence based practice; memory; problem solving; psychology; review; thinking; Animals; Cognition; Decision Making, Organizational; Humans; Memory; Mental Processes; Organizational Culture; Planning Techniques","QUINN, J.B., (1980) Strategies for Change: Logical Incrementalism, , Irwin.

In this sense, the province of Jaén, a southern Spanish region whose economy is mainly based on olive agriculture, has carried out its strategic plan aiming at a major socioeconomic development. Under the leadership of the provincial government and the University of Jaén, main provincial institutions joined to propose the elaboration of a participatory strategic plan for the whole province. Here, the elaboration of the energy part of the plan, which was directly focused on the exploitation of renewable resources, mainly solar and biomass energy, and which highlights the effectiveness of techniques from business management applied to a sustainable energy model design is presented. Renewable Energy development during the first years of plan execution is presented, and the impact of additional issues is discussed. It is concluded that, although multicriteria decision-making technologies (MCDA) are extensively used in energy planning, a different approach can be utilized to incorporate techniques from strategic analysis. Furthermore, SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis has proved to be an effective tool and has constituted a suitable baseline to diagnose current problems and to sketch future action lines. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

We interrogate how the role of the Auckland Regional Council (ARC) was zealously contested and hollowed-out during the 1990s. More recently, the impacts of the neo-liberal reforms in Auckland have been mediated by a further round of local government reforms inspired by a Third Way ideology and by the imperative to respond to the planning crisis resulting from infrastructure underinvestment. New regionally based governance arrangements and planning processes have been created. We argue that this new commitment to regionalism can realistically expect to be tested by deep-seated political cleavages within Auckland and by Auckland's relationship with central government. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © The New Zealand Geographical Society 2007.","Auckland; Governance; Government; Institutional arrangements; Metropolitan planning; New Zealand; Sustainability; Urban growth","governance approach; local government; metropolitan area; neoliberalism; reform process; strategic approach; sustainability; urban growth; urban politics; Auckland; Australasia; New Zealand; North Island","Draft Long-Term Community Council Plan 2006-16 (2006), Auckland Regional Council AucklandBarlow, I.M., (1991) Metropolitan Government, , Routledge, London; Briffault, R., Localism and regionalism (1999), http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=198822, (cited 19 May 2004).

This perspective holds great promise for development of an understanding on how strategy discourse and subjectivity are intertwined. We wish to add to this existing research by outlining a discursive struggle approach to subjectivity. To understand the complex subjectification and empowering/disempowering effects of organizational strategy discourse, this approach focuses on organization-specific discourse mobilizations and various ways of resistance. Drawing on an analysis of the discourses and practices of 'strategic development' in an engineering and consulting group we provide an empirical illustration of such struggles over subjectivity. In particular, we report three examples of competing ways of making sense of and giving sense to strategic development, with specific subjectification tendencies. First, we show how corporate management can mobilize and appropriate a specific kind of strategy discourse to attempt to gain control of the organization, which tends to reproduce managerial hegemony, but also trigger discursive and other forms of resistance. Second, we illustrate how middle managers resist this hegemony by initiating a strategy discourse of their own to create room for manoeuvre in controversial situations. Third, we show how project engineers can distance themselves from management-initiated strategy discourses to maintain a viable identity despite all kinds of pressures. Although our examples are case-specific, we believe that similar discursive dynamics also characterize strategizing in other organizations.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: United States. Participants: Nationwide random sample of 1,250 owners/managers of independent community pharmacies. Intervention: Mailed survey. Main Outcome Measures: Comprehensiveness of strategic planning conducted; components used in the strategic planning process. Attitudes and perceptions of owners/managers of independent community pharmacies toward strategic planning. Results: A total of 527 (42.1%) usable questionnaires were returned. Of the 141 (26.8%) respondents who indicated that they conduct strategic planning, most components of the process were used. However, only 78 (55.3%) of those respondents conducted a review of pharmacy systems, and only 60 (42.6%) periodically evaluated implemented strategies. Approximately 88% of the variance in comprehensiveness was accounted for by 12 variables identified as significantly associated with the comprehensiveness of strategic planning conducted by owners/managers of independent community pharmacies. These included factors such as favorable cost-benefit relationship, impact of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, and remaining competitive in the pharmacy marketplace. Conclusion: While a minority of the survey population, respondents who reported conducting strategic planning used a reasonably comprehensive process. Further, several variables were identified as significant factors associated with comprehensiveness of strategic planning conducted.","Community and ambulatory pharmacy; Strategic planning; Surveys","attitude; community care; cost benefit analysis; health care management; health care system; health survey; hospital department; human; medicare; pharmacy; review; strategic planning; article; attitude; cost; cross-sectional study; economics; organization and management; perception; pharmacist; United States; Attitude; Community Pharmacy Services; Costs and Cost Analysis; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Perception; Pharmacists; Planning Techniques; United States","Langley, A., The roles of formal strategic planning (1988) Long Range Plan, 21, pp. 40-50; Mankin, D.C., Glueck, W.F., Strategic planning (1977) Hosp Health Serv Adm, 22, pp. 6-22; Armstrong, J.S., The value of formal planning for strategic decisions: Review of empirical research (1982) Strategic Manage J, 3, pp. 197-211; Pathak, D.S., Integrating strategic planning and marketing for hospital pharmacy directors.

Design/methodology/ approach - General conclusions are drawn and strategic imperatives inferred from a review of the relevant literature and a set of case histories based on personal interviews with key executives in the Chinese operations of six large overseas consumer-goods companies. Findings - The undoubted strategic significance of guanxi has been diluted recently among joint ventures designated as ""encouraged"" by the Chinese government, and is being replaced by a market-driven paradigm of marketing operations. The guanxi-driven paradigm remains a crucial factor in planning and managing effective working relationships when the Chinese partner is one officially classified as ""restricted"". Case histories show that early success is no guarantee of continuing dominance, as indigenous competition intensifies and Chinese corporations become larger and better resourced. Research limitations/implications - Foreign multinational entrants to the Chinese market must remain sensitive to characteristically Chinese business and consumer behaviour, but can successfully adopt a more Western approach to marketing strategy in certain situations. It is essential to use marketing intelligence effectively, and to plan well beyond the short term. Originality/value - The authors' expert view of the current situation fro multinationals in China adds a useful extra dimension to the received wisdom.","China; Marketing planning; Multinational companies; Strategic planning",,"Abramson, N.R., Ai, J.X., ""Canadian companies doing business in China: Key success factors"" (1999) Management International Review, 39 (1), pp. 7-35; Ambler, T., ""Marketing's third paradigm: Guanxi"" (1994) Business Strategy Review, 5 (4), pp. 6-80; Ambler, T., Styles, C., Wang, X., ""The effect of channel relationships and guanxi on the performance of inter-province export ventures in the People's Republic of China"" (1999) International Journal of Research in Marketing, 16 (1), pp. 75-87; Arias, J.T.G., ""A relationship marketing approach to guanxi"" (1998) European Journal of Marketing, 32 (1-2), pp. 145-156; Assael, H., (1993) Marketing Principles and Strategy, , The Dryden Press Hinsdale, IL; Beamish, P.W., Wang, H.Y., ""Investing in China via joint ventures"" (1989) Management International Review, 29 (1), pp. 57-64; Boisot, M., Child, J., (1990) The Management of Equity Joint Ventures in China, , China-EC Management Institute Beijing; ""Local heroes"" (1997) Business China, pp. 1-3. , Business China 9 June; ""McDonald's alternative universe"" (1998) Business China, p. 12. , Business China; Chee, H., West, C., (2004) Myths About Doing Business in China, , Palgrave New York, NY; Chen, M.J., (2001) Inside Chinese Business: A Guide for Managers Worldwide, , Harvard Business School Press Cambridge, MA; ""China has more to cell"" (2000) ChinaOnline, , ChinaOnline 28 July; Davies, H., Leung, T.K.P., Luk, S.T.K., Wong, Y.H., ""The benefits of 'guanxi'.

Design/methodology/approach - The ""why, what, and how"" of IT strategic planning for libraries is explained, to show the efficacy and value of long-term IT planning and budgeting. The organization, design, processes, templates, and methodologies of IT strategic planning practices that have been proven and constantly refined through projects with academic, public, and national libraries are described. Findings - Principles described for IT strategic planning as a team-based enterprise learning process apply as well to the design and conduct of major IT procurements, where the organization also seeks best value IT outcomes for the long term. The approach is scalable with respect to the human resources and time required (e.g. three months, six months); the design and steps of the process; the methodologies employed; and the number, design, format, components, and contents of internal working documents and the published report(s). Originality/value - IT strategic planning educates the institution about choices and consequences, decides on technology priorities and investments, makes informed decisions with confidence, and delivers consensus-based outcomes and stakeholders' buy-in. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Higher education; Information systems; Libraries; Strategic planning",,"""CIC Libraries Strategic Plan, Strategic Directions for 1998"" Committee on Institutional Cooperation CIC Center for Library Initiatives Homepage. n.dMcNamara, C., ""Field guide to nonprofit strategic planning and facilitation"" (2003), www.managementhelp.org/plan_dec/str_plan/str_plan.htm, available at:(1999) Template for Information Management Strategic Planning, , Maryland Information Technology Support Center (ITSC) ITSC Rockville, MD; Tapscott, D., Caston, A., (1993) Paradigm Shift: The New Promise of Information Technology, , McGraw-Hill New York, NY","McGee, R.; RMG Consultants Inc., Chicago, IL, United States; email: rob@rmgconsultants.com",,,01435124,,,,"English","Libr.

Half of those respondents who produced annual reports used them as a public relations tool or for library advocacy. Consistent production of an annual report offers the librarian better internal management of library resources and services, and better external development of the public perception of the library.

The paper aims to focus on psychological type and its relationship to planning preferences. Design/methodology/approach: A study of 187 managers' profiling their psychological type (using a short version of the MBTI, Myers Briggs Type Indicator) and their preferences towards configuring the strategic planning process. A review of the literature finds inconsistent conclusions. The results of a study of the relationship between psychological type and planning preferences are reported. Findings: The study finds some inconsistent evidence for the importance of psychological type but greater support for the conclusion that the characteristics of strategic situations, rather than a manager's psychological type, determine configuration of the strategic planning process. Research limitations/implications: The existing bias towards examining the environmental, organizational and strategic context of organizations appears to be the more appropriate path for developing explanations of strategic planning design. Practical implications: For managers involved in the practice of planning the literature review a basis is provided for reviewing their own planning process. Educators and trainers using the MBTI in planning simulations should be aware of the lack of its reliability in predicting preferences concerning planning. Originality/value: The article reviews contextual studies that have implications for the design of the strategic planning process and develops understanding of a comparatively neglected contextual factor, psychological type. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Design; Organizational planning; Psychology; Type testing",,"""Bain study reveals how firms are using three main analytical tools"" (2003) Financial Times, , Bain and Co. 4 September; Bantel, K., ""Top team, environment, and performance effects on strategic planning formality"" (1993) Group and Organizational Management, 18 (4), pp. 436-458; Barringer, B.R., Bluedorn, A.C., ""The relationship between corporate entrepreneurship and strategic management"" (1999) Strategic Management Journal, 20, pp. 421-444; Blaylock, B.K., Rees, L.P., ""Cognitive style and the usefulness of information"" (1984) Management Science, 15, pp. 74-91; Brews, P.J., Hunt, M.R., ""Learning to plan and planning to learn: Resolving the planning school-learning school debate"" (1999) Strategic Management Journal, 20, pp. 889-913; Byrne, R., (1997) The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator: A Critical Review and Practical Guide, , Stanley Thornes (Publishers) Ltd Cheltenham; Carland, J.W., Carland, J.A.C., Busbin, J.W., ""Nurturing entrepreneurship: Reconsiderations for competitive strategy"" (1997) Advances in Competitive Research, 5 (1), pp. 85-105; Catford, L.R., ""Creative problem-solving in business synergy of thinking, intuitive, sensing and feeling strategies"" (1987), unpublished doctoral dissertation, Stanford University, Stanford, CAChakravarthy, B.S., ""On tailoring a strategic planning system to its context: Some empirical evidence"" (1987) Strategic Management Journal, 8, pp. 517-534; Chakravarthy, B.S., Lorange, P., ""Adapting strategic planning to the changing needs of a business"" (1991) Journal of Organizational Change Management, 4 (2), pp. 6-18; Chakravarthy, B.S., White, R.E., ""Strategy process; forming, implementing and changing strategies"" (2002) Handbook of Management and Strategy, pp. 182-205. , Pettigrew, A., Thomas, H. and Whittington, R.

It is based on a questionnaire survey of 57 firms and the results suggest that if entrepreneurs within small innovator firms feel the innovation can be commercialised with relatively few obstacles they will tend to downgrade the importance of external advisors. Greater value is placed on the views of customers and where the entrepreneur has the power to proceed with the innovation without recourse to other stakeholders he/she is most likely to go ahead if a positive response is received from leading customers. The article expands upon these findings to outline the design, development and application of a diagnostic assessment and screening tool to assist such entrepreneurs, formulate more systematic strategies than the response to an initial customer. © Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2006.","Case studies; Commercialisation; Diagnostic assessment; Entrepreneurs; Innovation; Small firms; Strategic decision making",,"Ajzen, I., Fishbein, M., (1980) Understanding Attitudes and Predicting Behaviour, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall; Akao, Y., Mazur, G.H., The leading edge in QFD: Past, present and future (2003) The International Journal of Quality & Reliability Management, 20 (1), pp. 20-35; Akgun, A.E., Lynn, G.S., Byrne, J.C., Taking the guess work out of new product development: How successful high-tech companies get that way (2004) Journal of Business Strategy, 25 (4), pp. 41-46; Autio, E., Lumme, A., Does the innovator role affect the perceived potential for growth?

Design/methodology/approach - Based on a postal questionnaire primary data was collected from 113 UK companies. A series of multivariate analyses were undertaken to test the hypothesized relationships. Findings - While hypotheses explaining the formality of a company's planning process were well accounted for, no relationship between formal planning process and subjective company performance was observed. Research limitations/implications - Measurement validity may be a problem. The data are cross-sectional, therefore causal linkages among the variables cannot be firmly established. Related to this point is the fact that firm performance is a function of prior, not current, planning and other management practices. Longitudinal data would be needed in order to prove that causal relationships exist and control for time lag effects. Originality/value - Despite the continued importance of performance objectives in the prescriptive literature, recent attention has not been given to strategic planning and performance in empirical research. One function of this paper is to re-kindle this area of research. More specifically, the empirical study reported in this paper draws on data from UK companies, which is novel in this stream of research. In a review of 29 relevant studies by Greenley (1994) the only study identified reporting UK data was that of Grinyer and Norburn (1975), the majority of the remaining studies reporting data from the USA. Greenley notes that while this represents a stream of research from a single business culture, the major issue is one of relevance to the practice of strategic planning in Europe and other countries. Although the principles of strategic planning should, of course, have universal application, there may be national differences in strategic planning, country dependent influences from business culture, and influences from different national trading conditions. The strategic management field can be criticized for not examining particular phenomena in non-US contexts, with respect to the impact of FSP and organizational performance this study attempts to rectify this imbalance. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Company performance; Strategic planning; United Kingdom",,"Ackelsberg, R., Arlow, P., ""Small businesses do plan and it does pay off"" (1985) Long Range Planning, 18 (5), pp. 61-67; Ackoff, R.L., (1970) A Concept of Corporate Planning, , John Wiley and Sons New York, NY; Andersen, T.J., ""Strategic planning, autonomous actions and corporate performance"" (2000) Long Range Planning, 33, pp. 184-200; Andersen, T.J., ""Integrating decentralized strategy making and strategic planning processes in dynamic environments"" (2004) Journal of Management Studies, 41 (8), pp. 1271-1299; Andersen, T.J., ""Integrating the strategy formation process: An international perspective"" (2004) European Management Journal, 22 (3), pp. 263-272; Ansoff, H.I., (1965) Corporate Strategy, , McGraw-Hill, New York, NY; Ansoff, H.I., ""Critique of Henry Mintzberg's 'The Design School: Reconsidering the basic premises of Strategic Management'"" (1991) Strategic Management Journal, 12 (6), pp. 449-462; Ansoff, H.I., Declerck, R.P., Hayes, R.L., (1976) From Strategic Planning to Strategic Management, , John Wiley and Sons New York, NY; Ansoff, H.I., Avner, J., Brandenburg, R.G., Portner, F.E., Radosevich, R., ""Does planning pay?

In spite of recent constructive changes for better in this sphere, methodical provision of strategic decisions evaluation is a field that lacks attention. The basic component of the suggested method for strategic decisions evaluation is a system of three levels of criteria uniting the following partial integrated criteria of compatibility, economic-financial, competitive and organizational culture criteria. The formation of these criteria is based on primary criteria paying attention to relative weight of each separate criterion. Paying attention to the diversity of exact combinations of business subjects and a broad wide of business conditions, the following controlled parameters are included into this system of criteria: The list of primary criteria, the weight of primary and partial criteria and the borders of quality assessment intervals. These controlled parameters are the most important preconditions for adaptable possibilities of the suggested method. Taking into account psychological aspects of decision making the evaluation of implementation risks of strategic decisions is given in another block. Strategic decisions are ranked according to the results of a complex integrated criterion and are presented for person making decisions accompanied by risk evaluations while implementing them. The following advantages are peculiar to the suggested method of strategic decisions evaluation: versatile and complex evaluation; alternative decisions are compared according to quantitative indicators which increase objectivity; less non productive evaluation expenditure; evaluation becomes transparent and clear to business subjects.","Criteria; Decisions evaluation; Multicriteria method; Strategy; System",,"Fahey, L., How corporations learn from scenarios (2003) Strategy & Leadership, 31 (2), pp. 5-15; Bivainis, J., Tamošiūnas, A.

There is a need for planning but this planning must be strategic in nature, focusing on the most important issues and allowing for the many uncertainties that are inherent in the current situation. The paper describes the field testing of a strategic planning process in India and subsequent efforts to explore ways of institutionalising the lessons learnt from this experience. It reveals some of the key problems encountered during these activities, in particular the lack of a planning culture among local stakeholders and the consequent tendency to respond to problems in ad hoc ways. Analysis of workshops and training courses suggests that there is a need to develop a more integrated approach to capacity building, with a strong emphasis on the way in which individual activities fit into overall planning and development processes. International development agencies could do more to encourage such an integrated approach to capacity building, planning and implementation. In doing so, they should recognise that, in the absence of a strong planning culture, informed decision making is often constrained by a lack of information. Where this is the case, it is critically important to extend the preparation stage of the project cycle to enable local stakeholders time gather the information required to develop a full understanding of problems and possibilities. © IWA Publishing 2005.","Capacity-building; Development; Planning; Sanitation; Strategy; Urbanisation",,"Allen, A., Environmental planning and management of the peri-urban interface: Perspectives on an emerging field (2003) Environment and Urbanization, 15 (1), pp. 135-147; Caiden, N., Wildavsky, A., (1974) Planning and Budgeting in Poor Countries, , Wiley, New York; Chambers, R., (1983) Rural Development; Putting the Last First, , Longman, London; Chambers, R., Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) - Analysis of experience (1994) World Development, 22 (9), pp. 1253-1268; Cotton, A., Tayler, K., (2000) Services for the Urban Poor.

Design/methodology/approach - The research consisted of a literature and documentation review, followed by interviews with academic library directors and senior institutional managers. There was also a survey of all UK HE libraries. Findings - The key issues which need to be addressed by academic libraries in terms of strategic planning are: the involvement of library staff; communication of library aims and plans externally; level of active involvement in institutional and departmental planning; evaluation and target setting; and involvement in more ""difficult"" institutional aims such as income generation and widening participation. Research limitation/implications - The response to the various activities of this research project indicate the lack of interest in outcomes assessment within the academic library sector. There is little rigorous evidence in this area to inform library professionals. Practical implications - The lack of interest in outcomes assessment with the sector is worrying; there is a general view of libraries as essential part of higher education and do not need to demonstrate how they contribute to institutional aims. This may leave libraries in a vulnerable position. Originality/value - The paper reports on an issue which should be of great concern to the academic library sector, especially in the light of the proposal to axe professional posts at the University of Wales, Bangor library. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Academic libraries; Communication; Project evaluation; Strategic planning; United Kingdom",,"Birdsall, D.G., ""Strategic planning in academic libraries: A political perspective"" (1997), available at: www.ala.org/ala/acrlbucket/pil49restructuri/birdsall.htmBryson, J.M., (1995) Strategic Planning for Public and Nonprofit Organizations: A Guide to Strengthening and Sustaining Organizational Achievement, , Jossey-Bass San Francisco; Corrall, S., (2000) Strategic Management of Information Services: A Planning Handbook, , Aslib/IMI London; Dougherty, R.M., ""Planning for new library futures: Supercharging the strategic planning process and applying it to the special needs of libraries"" (2002) Library Journal, 127 (9), pp. 38-41; Hanford, P., ""Developing director and executive competencies in strategic thinking"" (1996) Developing Strategic Thought: Rediscovering the Art of Direction-giving, , Garratt, B.

There seems to be no theory of strategy logic, i. e. the general process and management characteristics generating a certain strategy outcome. Strategy content research has presented a systematic analysis on the basis of competitive advantage, and strategy process research has provided careful in-depth descriptions and examinations of strategy making. However, the basic strategy logic, including the underlying procedures, activities and reasoning that generate a particular type of strategy, has been less commonly evaluated. In particular, principles and details of strategy making in complex situations seem less clear. The two most influential lines of research in strategic management in the last two decades, of the industrial-organization (IO) perspective on strategy (e.g. Porter, 1980, 1981) and the resource-based view (RBV) (e.g. Barney, 1986, 1991) have compellingly established that strategy grows out of exploiting industry and resource structures, respectively. However, these strategy content views do not appear to consider how industry and resource configurations are actually developed in terms of underlying logic. The process by which market imperfections in the form of entry barriers (Porter, 1980, 1981) and isolating mechanisms (Rumelt, 1984) in fact arise has not been determined. Implicitly, centrally located managers seem to play an important role in analyzing and planning competitive and resource positions, but the principles and mechanisms that form these strategic positions essentially remain unclear (Cockburn, Henderson, & Stern, 2000). The fundamental logic that generates a certain strategic outcome and, in the end, competitive advantage is not identified. Strategy-process views, in contrast, (e.g. Bower & Doz, 1979; Burgelman, 1983; Doz & Prahalad, 1987; Mintzberg, 1978; Johnson, 1987; Pettigrew, 1977; Quinn, 1980) have provided rich and systematic descriptions showing that strategy making involves a variety of contextual influences and actors in addition to analytical exercises and leadership by managers at the center. However, our understanding of the particulars of these alternative strategy processes still appears to be imperfect. A whole range of contextual influences (political, cognitive, cultural, symbolic, etc.) have been identified (e.g. Johnson, 1987; Pettigrew, 1985; Porac & Thomas, 1990), but it is not entirely clear how they influence and shape strategy outcome. In brief, it is unclear how different procedures, activities and reasoning generate certain strategy content. Hence, the fundamental strategy logic is likewise rather indeterminate in strategy process views as well as in strategy content approaches. While characteristics regarding strategy (planning) procedures have been described for rather well-defined strategic issues, the basic logic in strategy is particularly unclear in situations that are complex - i. e. where resources and industries are less defined, and markets and products are unclear. In fact, it seems as if one common way of avoiding an examination of a basis or logic in strategy is to assume the existence of a strategy and its central artifacts and contexts from the start. The role for research then becomes one of explaining the characteristics of competitive advantage (strategy content) or describing the general process of its development and/or implementation (strategy process) ex post. However, the procedures, activities and reasoning generating and creating competitive advantage and strategy are rarely addressed (Regnér, 1999). Another approach that avoids the question of strategy logic is to present strategy as an art; this approach is common both in more planning-oriented writings (Christensen, Andrews, Bower, Hamermesh, & Porter, 1982) and in more process-oriented literature (Mintzberg, 1975). This approach run the risk of precluding critical examinations of the actual mechanisms and procedures involved by placing reliance on intuition and feelings, which are highly difficult to examine. Perhaps not surprisingly, research has often responded with this tactic since managers themselves often refer to ""gut feelings"" and undefined circumstantial events in explaining why a particular strategy outcome finally presented itself. Art is certainly an important part of the answer, especially in situations of uncertainty (Szulanski & Amin, 2000), but by reducing strategy under more complicated circumstances exclusively to artistic talent or questions of chance, we risk overlooking important aspects of strategy making and, furthermore, denying managers relevant and systematic knowledge that might be useful in practice. It might be argued that strategy is in fact most relevant precisely in complex circumstances, where research evaluations of strategy logic seem most vague (Schoemaker, 1990; Regnér, 2001). When optimization is possible the strategic complexity is low, the question of strategy is actually of little interest, at least for generating long run above-average returns. Finally, the revelation of the strategy logic or principles that underlie different strategy processes, would seem crucial for understanding not only how strategy outcome and content are actually generated, but also what type of capabilities that are important in developing competitive advantage (Teece, Pisano, & Shuen, 1997). This paper seeks to identify fundamental principles in strategy - the general process and management characteristics involved in diverse types of strategy making, including the underlying procedures, activities and reasoning - and how they generate different strategy outcomes. It distinguishes between two types of strategy process or strategy logics and addresses the question how they influence strategy. Based on the prior work in economics, cybernetics and organizational change and learning, it proposes a dynamic view of strategy processes as involving two fundamentally different types of strategy logic depending on external context and internal location. Besides discussing the relationship to the prior strategy process research, the paper suggests possible links to new theoretical developments in strategic management such as the dynamic capabilities view (Teece et al., 1997) and related evolutionary and learning views (Winter, 2000; Zollo & Winter, 2002), and the activity-based view (Johnson, Melin, & Whittington, 2003). It ends with a discussion of interactions between the two logics. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Our central argument is that organisations can learn from the development of strategic planning in the 1970s and 1980s. We identify three weaknesses - a bureaucratic and formalised approach, lack of implementation and lack of integration throughout the organisation - which were prevalent in strategic planning in the past and which are potentially just as problematic for an integrated corporate governance approach to business ethics. We suggest ways these weaknesses might be avoided and provide questions for boards of directors to consider when integrating ethical concerns into their organisations' corporate governance structures. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.","Business ethics; Corporate governance; Strategic planning",,"Adam, A.M., Rachman-Moore, D., The methods used to implement an ethical code of conduct and employee attitudes (2005) Journal of Business Ethics, 54, pp. 225-244; (2003) Pan Pharmaceuticals, , http://www.choice.com.au/viewArticle.aspx?id=103731&catId= 100386&tid=100008&p=1; (2003) Good Governance Principles, , Australian Standard AS8000.

Methods: Prepared through author-led consensus-seeking serial deliberations with occupational health experts over initial and consequential drafts of, latterly, a populated strategic planning framework based on key stages in a military career. Illustrative examples are provided from the author's experience and, along with referenced sources of further information, the scientific literature. Results: The resulting framework facilitates timely management of occupational health risks to recruiting, retention, operational availability and capability, and the general well-being of military personnel. Monitoring and audit are integral to the activity to provide an evidence-based spiral of refinement of the plan and improvement of outcomes. Conclusions: Key stages of the military career may provide manageable challenge bites for planning with executive and health care colleagues to forecast and control occupational health risks to operational capability and thus contribute to achieving military objectives.

Between 1989 and 1998, field case studies were made of 100 strategic investment decisions (SIDs) by manufacturers in these four countries. Longitudinal judgements were supplemented by earlier comparative strategy field research carried out in 60 suppliers between 1980 and 1983, and two longitudinal case studies, one from the UK and one from Japan, interviewed throughout both these periods and again in 2002. Two competing hypotheses, derived from rich research literatures, are investigated. The first (H1) suggests that national institutional and cultural factors exert profound differences, and should therefore be afforded more significance as globalization proceeds further. The second (H2) is apparently contradictory and emphasizes that institutions and organizations are likely to respond to convergence pressures, spurred by global capital markets and competition on the one hand, and a diffusion of 'professional management' practices on the other. Japanese firms generally, and German family firms in particular, were still found to exhibit deep-rooted differences from the Anglo-Saxon model, which appears to confirm H1. However study of German public companies reveals that their strategic approaches are far less divergent from what is now an increasingly consistent Anglo-Saxon model than they were a decade ago, which appears to confirm the competing hypothesis H2. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.",,,"Albert, M., Strategy styles and different blends of capitalism (1994) Keynote Address to the 14th Annual Conference of the Strategic Management Society, , 21 September.

This paper applies established qualitative research methods to the online environment to evaluate how web managers generate and incorporate web metrics to inform strategic marketing decisions. Design/methodology/approach - Initial theories were developed using a comprehensive literature review as well as exploratory interviews with New Zealand companies. Applying a mixed methodology, the exploratory research used interviews to assess current practice within the industry, refine the research questions and set up the research design. An in-depth case study in the USA evaluated best practices and highlighted issues that affect the use of web metrics. The main data collection utilized case studies to generate the in-depth information necessary for theory building. Findings - The exploratory results showed that companies currently measure web site performance and consumer behaviour online but are still uncertain how best to use those metrics to inform strategic marketing decisions. The in-depth case study showed how web metrics can be used when sufficient resources are available and measuring performance is a priority. Owing to the initially recognized low level of web metrics use, the main research was expanded purposively to selected participants who make greater use of web metrics. Originality/value - This paper applies traditional qualitative research methods to the online environment. Analysis of the case studies and continued research will address the research gap and provide recommendations to web managers as well as attempt to illustrate best practices, solutions to issues and industry benchmarks. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Case Studies; Internet; Marketing strategy; Qualitative research; Strategic planning",,"Adam, S., Deans, K.R., (2000) Online Business in Australia and New Zealand: Crossing a Chasm, , AUSWEB2K, Southern Cross University, Cairns; Berthon, P., Ewing, M., Pitt, L., Naude, P., ""Understanding B2B and the web: The acceleration of coordination and motivation"" (2003) Industrial Marketing Management, 32, pp. 553-561; Bertot, J.C., McClure, C.R., Moen, W.E., Rubin, J., ""Web usage statistics: Measurement issues and analytical techniques"" (1997) Government Information Quarterly, 14 (4), pp. 373-395; Bhaskar, R., (1978) Realist Theory of Science, , Harvester-Wheatsheaf, Brighton; Bonoma, T.V., ""Case research in marketing: Opportunities, problems, and a process"" (1985) Journal of Marketing Research, 22 (2), pp. 199-208; Carson, D., Gilmore, A., Perry, C., Gronhaug, K., (2001) Qualitative Marketing Research, , Sage Publications, London; Cope, O., Waddell, D., ""An audit of leadership styles in e-commerce"" (2001) Managerial Auditing Journal, 16 (9), pp. 523-529; Dennis, C., Harris, L., Sandhu, B., ""From bricks to clicks: Understanding the e-consumer"" (2002) Qualitative Market Research: An International Journal, 5 (4), p. 281; Dickson, P.R., ""Dynamic strategic thinking"" (2001) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 29 (3), pp. 216-237; Dikolli, S.S., Sedatole, K.L., (2001) The Structure of Leading Indicator Performance Relations: Evidence from Online Retailing, pp. 1-39. , McCombs School of Business, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX; Donnellan, E., ""Changing perspectives on research methodology in marketing"" (1995) Irish Marketing Review, 8, pp. 81-90; Doyle, P., Wong, V., ""Marketing and competitive performance: An empirical study"" (1998) European Journal of Marketing, 32 (5-6), pp. 514-535; Eisenhardt, K.M., ""Building theories from case study research"" (1989) Academy of Management Review, 14 (4), pp. 532-550; Eisenhardt, K.M., ""Strategy as strategic decision making"" (1999) Sloan Management Review, 40 (3), pp. 65-73; Griffith, D.A., Krampf, R.F., ""An examination of the web-based strategies of the top 100 US retailers"" (1998) Journal of Marketing Theory and Practice, pp. 12-23. , Summer; Harris, S., Sutton, R., ""Functions of parting ceremonies in dying organizations"" (1986) Academy of Management Journal, 29, pp. 5-30; Hawker, A., ul-Haq, R., ""Data capture, marketing and the internet"" (2001) Qualitative Market Research: An International Journal, 4 (2), p. 112; Hughes, T.J., ""Marketing principles in the application of e-commerce"" (2002) Qualitative Market Research: An International Journal, 5 (4), p. 252; Hunt, S.D., (1991) Modern Marketing Theory, , Southwestern, Cincinnati, OH; Maclaran, P., Catterall, M., ""Analysing qualitative data: Computer software and the market research practitioner"" (2002) Qualitative Market Research: An International Journal, 5 (1), p. 28; Mason, J., (2002) Qualitative Researching, , Sage Publications, Thousand Oaks, CA; Merrilees, B., ""Do traditional strategic concepts apply in the e-marketing context?""

However, the increasing complexity of organizations' internal and external environments and the unstructured nature of decisions at the strategic level make the decision making a very complicated task. The number of influential variables is so large and their effects are so varied that any attempt to encapsulate them in a rational manner can indeed hinder the decision making process. To this end, this research explores the advantages of decision support tools and the benefit these tools can yield for the strategic management. Some of these tools are deterministic and structured: they rely on straightforward calculation or optimisation techniques. The solution to the unstructured problems, however, has relied on heuristic approaches and judgement of the decision-maker. While deterministic problems have to a large extent been addressed and appropriate models and algorithm have been developed for them, the unstructured problems have remained relatively unattended and the research works in this area tend to focus on single issues. This paper conceptualizes an umbrella framework using a ""Viable Systems Diagnosis "" VSD Model and a ""Decision Framework"", within which strategic decision making research applicable to construction can be coordinated and developed, thus avoiding wasteful duplication and gaps in knowledge. To this end, the research highlights the relevance and potential use of artificial intelligent techniques in assisting the managers with unstructured decisions. Further, it is argued that a strategic decision support system should assume an integrated structure, as many decision nodes, within the overall decision making structure, share common attributes and the inter-connection amongst these decision nodes has a complex structure. Therefore, the object oriented approach will provide an efficient structure for the development of the overall framework.","Artificial intelligence; Artificial neural network; Building; Decision support tools; Executive information system; Executive management; Management decision structure","Artificial intelligence; Buildings; Construction industry; Contracts; Decision support systems; Industrial management; Neural networks; Societies and institutions; Strategic planning; Decision support tools; Executive information systems; Executive management; Management decision structure; Decision making","Ahmad, I., Minkarah, I., Decision analysis and expert system technology: A construction industry perspective (1990) Proc.

Indeed, recent surveys and business press articles indicate broad support for the use of intuition when making strategic decisions. The need for quick decisions, the need to cope with demands created by complex market forces, and the assumed benefits of applying deeply held knowledge combine to create strong perceived value for the intuitive approach. Intuition, however, has not been subjected to sufficient review, particularly in a forum for executives and other managers. This article responds to the need for critical evaluation. Utilizing holistic hunch and automated expertise as two fundamental definitions, our review evaluates intuition's costs and benefits in light of an organization's goals. Drawing evidence from the fields of behavioral decision making, strategic decision making, and mental modeling, our conclusions suggest intuition is a troublesome decision tool.

Improvement calls for insight into what brings about failure and ways to avoid it. The article shows that failed decisions stem from decision-maker actions in which blunders create traps and traps bring about failure. Blunders arise when decision-makers rush to judgment, use failure-prone practices, and allocate time and money unwisely. Here we consider how these blunders set a trap that limits the search for remedies. Three approaches are offered for expanding the search for alternatives and avoiding the limited-search trap. First, decision-makers should expand the arena of action by identifying key stakeholders, their concerns and claims. The second approach is to increase the clarity of objectives and select one that defines an arena of action with the broadest possible scope. The third is to use multiple perspectives to uncover options that would otherwise be undiscovered. Successful decision-makers add innovative options to the mix of remedies to be considered. Shell's attempts to dispose of an obsolete oilrig. Quaker's purchase of Snapple, and Columbus, Ohio's seeking of tax support for a sports arena illustrate how the three blunders can limit the alternatives search and discourage innovation. The article recommends search tactics that can help decision-makers be sure that they are exploring a full range of decision options.",,,"Nutt, P.C., (2002) Why Decisions Fail., , San Francisco: Berrett-Koehler; noteKolb, D., Problem management: Learning from experience (1983) The Executive Mind, pp. 109-143. , S., Srivastra (Ed.), San Francisco, CA: Jossey Bass; Janis, I., (1989) Crucial Decisions, , New York: Free Press; Pounds, W., The process of problem finding (1969) Industrial Management Review, pp. 1-19. , Fall; Wildavsky, A., (1979) Speaking Truth to Power, , Boston: Little Brown; Mintzberg, H., Westley, F., (2000) Decision-making: It's Not What You Think, , Unpublished Manuscript, August 2000; Starbuck, W.H., Organizations as action generators (1983) American Sociological Review, 48, pp. 91-102; March, J.G., (1994) A Primer on Decision Making: How Decisions Happen, , New York: Free Press; Cyert, R.M., March, J.G., (1963) A Behavioral Theory of the Firm, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall; Nutt, P.C., The identification of solution ideas during organizational decision making (1993) Management Science, 39 (9), pp. 1071-1085; Mintzberg, H., Raisinghani, D., Theoret, A., The structure of unstructured decisions (1976) Administrative Science Quarterly, 21 (2), pp. 246-275; Nutt, (1993) Administrative Science Quarterly; Nutt, P.C., Evaluating complex strategic choices (1998) Management Science, 44 (8), pp. 1148-1166; (1998) Management Science, 44 (8), pp. 1148-1166; Nutt, (1993) Management Science; Damanpour, F., Organizational innovation and preference: The problem of ""organizational lag.""

Although emergency management has a tradition of strategic planning, the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA's) conceptual framework for dealing with disasters has several assumptions that are violated by terrorist activities. Specifically this paper calls for three new strategic thrusts in emergency planning: a) ongoing monitoring of situations requiring new technology, and coordination and communication systems; b) a more dynamic, game-theoretic approach that utilizes simulation and modeling; and, c) greater emphasis on training for decision-making skills and judgment that employs recent research findings in naturalistic decision-making. Higher education training in decision-making skills can benefit from recent findings in naturalistic decision making that indicate we can quicken the pace of acquiring decision making skills by ""learning how experts learn"" and instruction in how to develop back-up models for decision-making.",,"academic achievement; decision making; disaster; education program; emergency health service; emergency medicine; health care planning; interpersonal communication; leadership; medical staff; organization; review; skill; technique; terrorism; theoretical model; training; university",,"Blanco, H.; Department of Urban Design, Coll. of Architecture/Urban Planning, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States",,,10955127,,JBBUF,,"English","J.

The study has been done from the perspective of the community as a whole and has been undertaken in two phases reflecting the different objectives of Australian state surveys in terms of the exploration industry and government policy-making. This paper reports on the second part of this valuation process, measuring the impact of upgraded survey data on government mineral policy decision processes. The valuation methodology developed is a comparative approach used to determine net benefit foregone by not upgrading information infrastructure. The underlying premise for the geological survey study is that existing and upgraded data sets will have a different probability that a deposit will be detected. The approach used in the valuation of geoscientific data introduces a significant technical component with the requirement to model both favorability of mineral occurrence and probability of deposit occurrence for two different generations of government data. The estimation of mineral potential uses modern quantitative methods, including the U.S. Geological Survey three-part resource-assessment process and computer-based prospectivity modeling. To test the methodology mineral potential was assessed for porphyry copper type deposits in part of the Yarrol Province, central Queensland. Results of the Yarrol case study supports the strategy of the state surveys to facilitate effective exploration by improving accuracy and acquiring new data, as part of resource management. It was determined in the Yarrol Province case study that in going from existing to upgraded data sets the area that would be considered permissible for the occurrence of porphyry type deposits almost doubled. The implication of this result is that large tracts of potentially mineralized land would not be identified using existing data. Results of the prospectivity modeling showed a marked increase in the number of exploration targets and in target rankings using the upgraded data set. A significant reduction in discovery risk also is associated with the upgraded data set, a conclusion supported by the fact that known mines with surface exposure are not identified in prospectivity modeling using the existing data sets. These results highlight the absence in the existing data sets of information critical for the identification of prospective ground. Quantitative resource assessment and computer-based prospectivity modeling are seen as complementary processes that provide the support for the increasingly sophisticated needs of Australian survey clients. Significant additional gains to the current value of geoscientific data can be achieved through the in-house analysis and characterization of individual data sets, the integration and interpretation of data sets, and the incorporation of information on geological uncertainty. © 2001 International Association for Mathematical Geology.","Mineral potential modeling; Quantitative resource assessment; Strategic planning",,"Agterberg, F.P., Systematic approach to dealing with uncertainty of geoscience information in mineral exploration (1989) Proc. 21st Symp.

The system implements modelling concepts originally developed to evaluate project execution strategies, extending and generalizing the modelling methodology to a broader range of strategic decisions. An application to a construction firm's strategic planning is used in this paper to illustrate the modelling process. The computer system is designed to help the users in building a conceptual model for the decision problem, this model is a simplified structure of the variables and interactions that influence the decisions being analysed, including internal as well as external factors. An analytical model is then designed to predict the impact of these strategies, integrating expert knowledge and assessments of the strategic planning team into a mathematical model. The mathematical component uses concepts of cross-impact analysis and probabilistic inference to capture uncertainties and interactions among project variables. The system provides multiple analysis capabilities, including sensitivity analysis, selected outcome prediction, isolated or combined effect of strategies and changes in performance due to changes in the external environment. The system allows management to test different combinations of long-term strategies and predict expected sales, market share or other measures of performance. © 2000, MCB UP Limited","Construction firms; Performance modelling; Strategic decision-making process",,"Abourizk, S., Alpina, D., Wilson, J., Fitting beta distributions based on sample data (1994) Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, 120, pp. 288-305; Alarcón, L.F., Ashley, D.B., (1992) Project Performance Modelling: A Methodology for Evaluating Project Execution Strategies, , A Report to the Construction Industry Institute, The University of Texas at Austin, Source Document 80; Alarcón, L.F., Ashley, D.B., Modelling project performance for decision making (1996) Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, 122, pp. 265-273; Alarcón, L.F., Ashley, D.B., Project management decision making using cross-impact analysis (1998) International Journal of Project Management, 16, pp. 145-152; Alarcón, L.F., Venegas, P., Bastias, A., Computer-aided project decision making (1995) 3rd International Conference on Computing in Civil Engineering, pp. 1553-1560. , a), In: (ed.

Strategic planning is criticized for stifling creative responses to the new marketplace and for fostering compartmentalized organizations, adherence to outmoded strategies, tunnel vision in strategy formulation, and overemphasis on planning to the detriment of implementation. However, effective strategic planning can be a force for mobilizing all the constituents of an organization, creating discipline in pursuit of a goal, broadening an organization's perspective, improving communication among disciplines, and motivating the organization's workforce. It is worthwhile for healthcare organizations to preserve these benefits of strategic planning, at the same time recognizing the many sources of turbulence and uncertainty in the healthcare environment. A model of 'strategic cycling' is presented to address the perceived shortcomings of traditional strategic planning in a dynamic environment. The cycling model facilitates continuous assessment of the organization's mission/values/vision and primary strategies based on feedback from benchmark analysis, shareholder impact, and progress in strategy implementation. Multiple scenarios and contingency plans are developed in recognition of the uncertain future. The model represents a compromise between abandoning strategic planning and the traditional, linear model of planning based on progress through predetermined stages to a masterpiece plan.",,"health care management; health care organization; health care policy; review; United States; Benchmarking; Economic Competition; Efficiency, Organizational; Evaluation Studies; Guideline Adherence; Health Care Costs; Health Facility Planning; Investments; Models, Organizational; Organizational Objectives; Planning Techniques; United States","Aaker, D., (1992) Developing Business Strategies, , New York: John Wiley & Sons; Abell, D., (1993) Managing with Dual Strategies: Mastering the Present, Preempting the Future, , New York: Free Press; Birnbaum, W., (1990) If Your Strategy is So Terrific, How Come it Doesn't Work?, , New York: American Management Association; Blair, J.D., Fottler, M.D., (1998) Strategic Leadership for Medical Groups, , San Francisco: Jossey-Bass; Boyd, B., Strategic planning and financial performance: A meta-analytic review (1991) Journal of Management Studies, 28 (4), pp. 353-374; Bruton, G., Oviatt, B., Kallas-Bruton, L., Strategic planning in hospitals: A review and proposal (1995) Health Care Management Review, 20 (3), pp. 16-25; Cleverley, W., How boards can use comparative data in strategic planning (1989) Healthcare Executive, 4, pp. 32-33; Curtis, K., (1994) From Management Goal Setting to Organizational Results, , Westport, CT: Quorum; Daft, R.L., Lengel, R.H., (1998) Fusion Leadership, , San Francisco: Berrett-Koehler; D'Aveni, R.A., (1994) Hypercompetition, , New York: Free Press; Drain, M., Godkin, L., A portfolio approach to strategic hospital analysis: Exposition and explanation (1996) Health Care Management Review, 21 (4), pp. 68-74; Georgantzas, N., Acar, W., (1995) Scenario-driven Planning: Learning to Manage Strategic Uncertainty, , Westport, CT: Quorum; Ghoshal, S., Westney, D., Organizing competitor analysis systems (1991) Strategic Management Journal, 12, pp. 17-31; Ginter, P.M., Swayne, L.E., Duncan, W.J., (1998) Strategic Management of Health Care Organizations, Ed 3., , Malden, MA: Blackwell; Gray, D., Uses and misuses of strategic planning (1986) Harvard Business Review, 64, pp. 89-97; Hamel, G., Prahalad, C.K., (1994) Competing for the Future, , Boston: Harvard Business School Press; Hax, A., Majluf, N., (1991) The Strategy Concept and Process, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall; Henderson, J., Aligning business and information technology domain: Strategic planning in hospitals (1992) Hospital & Health Services Administration, 37 (1), pp. 71-87; Lane, D., Maxfield, R., Strategy under complexity: Fostering generative relationships (1996) Long Range Planning, 29 (2), pp. 215-231; Langley, A., In search of rationality: The purposes behind the use of formal analysis in organizations (1989) Administrative Science Quarterly, 34, pp. 598-631; Lenz, R.T., Paralysis by analysis: Is your planning system becoming too rational?

First, we present a comprehensive conceptualization of planning processes along six design dimensions. Second, in addition to examining the effects of environments, technology, and organizational complexity, we assess the effects of the organization's strategic orientation on the design of planning processes. Third, we move towards a configurational approach and explore the effects of concurrent presence of multiple contingencies. The study uses data from a large sample of North American corporations. The results suggest that the forces of context govern the design of planning processes. Furthermore, exploration of the effects of concurrent presence of multiple contingencies provides interesting illustrations of situations where the forces of context are aligned in the same direction as well as situations where the forces pull in opposite directions.",,,"Ansoff, H.I., The changing shape of the strategic problem (1979) Strategic Management: A New View of Business Policy and Planning, pp. 30-44. , Schendel, D.

This is seen as complementary to other innovations relating to management and policy issues. Advanced mining technology should most sensibly be achieved through evolutionary change, whereby new enabling technologies are integrated with conventional mining technology. Four key components of evolutionary change are considered in detail: incremental advances in conventional mining technology; creation of the digital mine and intelligent mining through information technology; automation of conventional mining practices; and development of distance mining. The case is also made, however, to counteract the current trend away from more revolutionary R&D, to anticipate longer term needs which will warrant more radical change in methods and equipment.",,,"Scoble, M., Competitiveness at depth: Re-engineering the hardrock mining process (1994) Proc. 1st.

However, rather than focusing on previously examined individual differences, this study examined differences in the decision-making processes used by entrepreneurs and managers in large organizations. Building on nonrational decision-making models from behavioral decision theory, we asserted that entrepreneurs are more susceptible to the use decision-making biases and heuristics than are managers in large organizations. To understand why entrepreneurs and managers in large organizations may vary in the extent to which they manifest biases and heuristics in their decision-making, it is important to understand the utility of nonrational decision-making. Under conditions of environmental uncertainty and complexity, biases and heuristics can be an effective and efficient guide to decision-making. In such settings, more comprehensive and cautious decision-making is not possible, and biases and heuristics may provide an effective way to approximate the appropriate decisions. The use of heuristics has also been found to be associated with innovativeness. Perhaps a critical difference between these sets of individuals is the extent to which they manifest biases and heuristics in their decision-making. We examined differences between entrepreneurs and managers in large organizations with respect to two biases and heuristics: overconfidence (overestimating the probability of being right) and representativeness (the tendency to overgeneralize from a few characteristics or observations). In this study, entrepreneurs are those who have founded their own firms and are currently involved in the start-up process with the average time since founding of 1.7 years. The analysis for this study involved responses from 124 entrepreneurs. Managers are individuals with middle to upper level responsibilities with substantial oversight in large organizations. To be included in this study, the managers had to oversee at least two functional areas (sample average was 4.55 functional areas). Usable responses were received from 95 managers. The results from the logistic regression analysis show strong support for both hypotheses. Even after controlling for numerous factors, such as several traits and demographic factors, enduring support was found for the way entrepreneurs and managers in large organizations make decisions. Our overconfidence and representativeness variables correctly categorized entrepreneurs and managers more than 70% of the time. Thus, this research indicates that entrepreneurs do behave differently than do managers in large organizations and that these differences are substantial. Practically, we speculate that without the use of biases and heuristics, many entrepreneurial decisions would never be made. With entrepreneurial ventures in particular, the window of opportunity would often be gone by the time all the necessary information became available for more rational decision-making. Additionally, successfully starting a new business usually involves overcoming multiple hurdles. Using biases and heuristics as simplifying mechanisms for dealing with these multiple problems may be crucial. To face such hurdles from a strict econometric approach would not only postpone decisions, but would in all likelihood make them overwhelming. More specifically, overconfidence may be particularly beneficial in implementing a specific decision and persuading others to be enthusiastic about it as well. The use of biases and heuristics may also offer some help in explaining why entrepreneurs sometimes make bad managers. Whereas the use of cognitive biases may be beneficial in some circumstances, it can lead to major errors in others. Although research has yet to establish performance implications, it is possible that the more extensive use of heuristics in strategic decision-making may be a great advantage during the start-up years. However, it may also lead to the demise of a business as a firm matures. © 1997 Elsevier Science Inc.",,,"Abelson, R.P., Levi, A., Decision-making and decision theory (1985) The Handbook of Social Psychology, 1, pp. 231-308. , G.

To thrive in this changing marketplace, wound clinic practitioners must understand the background of managed care and its terms, and be familiar with the concepts of capitation and incentives. Part of managed care's impact upon the specialty of wound care is that practitioners must define outcomes, healing rates and standards of care. Patient referral will depend on the cost effective delivery of care from all specialists in addition to the primary care physician. To meet these needs the authors created a hospital based wound care clinic with multiple interrelated areas of influence and have gathered statistical data. Managed care is here to stay and wound care practitioners must learn how to prepare for it and deal with it effectively.",,"cost benefit analysis; health insurance; human; injury; organization and management; outpatient department; patient referral; review; treatment outcome; wound healing; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Humans; Managed Care Programs; Outpatient Clinics, Hospital; Planning Techniques; Referral and Consultation; Treatment Outcome; Wound Healing; Wounds and Injuries",,"Ennis, W.J.",,,08895899,,,8716034,"English","Ostomy Wound Manage",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030116592

The authors present an approach that can help AHCs visualize possible new configurations of their traditional services of research, education, and clinical care. This approach is based on successful strategic management methods from the private sector and involves a three-dimensional 'topography of services' encompassing all possible configurations of AHCs' services. From among the many possible configurations, the authors discuss three in detail. The historic one, which they call the traditional model, is characteristic of AHCs that give high priority to biomedical and clinical 'research, have broad medical education activities, and deliver comprehensive, high-quality clinical care. In the future, this configuration will be rare, and two others are likely to predominate. First is the 'revised' traditional model, which would offer 'boutique' clinical services, biomedical research, and medical education for MD-PhD students, residents, and fellows seeking tertiary care or academic careers. The patient care required for undergraduate medical education and clinical research would be provided by partnerships with community-based providers. Second is the academic services model, which would focus on competitive primary and secondary clinical services, health services and operations research, and primary care medical education. The authors discuss the implications of these models for AHCs' organizational structures and faculty incentives. They conclude that the clarity with which AHCs' strategic decisions are made and communicated to faculties and the incentive systems that are selected to motivate faculty and to provide the selected services may ultimately determine which institutions survive.",,"decision making; health care delivery; medical education; medical research; patient care; priority journal; resource allocation; review; university hospital","McHugh, P.R., A ""letter of experience"" about faculty promotion in medical schools (1994) Acad Med, 69, pp. 877-881; Evans, C.H., Faculty development in a changing academic environment (1995) Acad Med, 70, pp. 14-20; Jolly, P., Jolin, L., Krakower, J., Beran, R., Financing medical education (1991) Acad Med, 66, pp. 563-576; Billi, J., Wise, C., Middleton, S., Buikhouldt, J., Financial impact of the Medicare fee schedule on a large multispecialty faculty practice in an academic medical center (1993) Acad Med, 68, pp. 315-322; Porter, M.E., (1980) Competitive Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors, , New York: The Free Press; Duncan, J., Ginter, P., Swayne, L., (1995) Strategic Management of Health Care Organizations, pp. 273-278. , Cambridge, MA: Blackwell Publishers; Pings, C.J., An open letter to the administration on indirect costs (1994) Acad Med, 69, pp. 356-358; National Institute of Standards and Technology, Health Care Pilot Criteria, Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award.

Managers often focus exclusively on adapting the organization to circumstances in its environment. This approach overlooks opportunities for fostering environmental changes that will be favorable for the organization. Such changes often can be achieved through political action. Political action is an extension of the process of maximizing opportunities and averting threats. It requires the additional work of policy analysis and stakeholder assessment followed by developing and implementing a political strategy. The strategy must consider the possibilities for effective intervention at one or more of the five stages of the policy process. The choices also must take into account the positions of other stakeholders and the costs and benefits that the organization anticipates from each of the four strategic approaches: indirect action, collaboration, negotiation, and contest.",,"cost benefit analysis; decision making; environmental factor; health care cost; health care organization; health care planning; health care policy; human; politics; review; Health Policy; Laboratories, Hospital; Lobbying; Planning Techniques; Policy Making; United States",,,,,08887950,,CLMRE,10138949,"English","CLIN.

The most important of these issues were selected by asking health department managers to evaluate the issues according to their probability of occurrence and likely impact on the health department. The high-probability, high-impact issues formed the basis for developing scenario logics that constitute the story line holding the scenario together.

Due in part to the use of forms of problem-solving that are incongruent with tribal values and cultural patterns, many Indian communities have been paralyzed in their efforts to develop consensus on strategic plans. While many tribes have experimented with various forms of conflict management techniques, careful consideration must be given to the appropriateness of the approach employed Because the cultural traditions of Indian communities are rooted in a consensual approach to problem-solving, dispute resolution approaches imposed by non-Indian law and bureaucracies often conflict with tribal values.

Most American and Western executives do not, however, devote sufficient time or effort to learn the art of negotiation or to understand the cultural differences among nations. The accelerating interdependency among global societies and the growing role of U.S. and Western countries in international trade, especially with Third World governments, strongly necessitate learning, experience, and training in this important task. True understanding of environmental determinants, styles, and tactics of international business negotiations is a must, if one is to achieve desirable outcomes. The old attitude of bargaining overseas and the John Wayne approach loill not work anymore. “Go native” and “adaptibility” will be the key words for successful international business negotiations in the future. © 1984, MCB UP Limited.
